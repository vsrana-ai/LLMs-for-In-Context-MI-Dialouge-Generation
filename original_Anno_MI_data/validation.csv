8,"Therapist: So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help? ; Client: Yeah. Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is 'cause my wife thinks I've got a problem with smoking. I've been smoking all my life and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, uh, so that's why I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and— ; Therapist: So, you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon. ; Client: Yeah. That's an understatement. I mean, I'm supposed to be at work right now, too, right? So- ; Therapist: You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and money being here. ; Client: Yeah, yeah. I'm only here because my wife forced me to come, you know. Like this has come to a head six months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit. ; Therapist: So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking? ; Client: Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about second-hand smoke and— ; Therapist: Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read. ; Client: Yeah, I've got to read this. That's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go out and have-- We used to go out and have a cigarette together at the table. Now I have to go outside in this weather, you know, what's that about? And she used to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than now? ; Therapist: So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago. ; Client: And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on me, you know what I mean? ; Therapist: So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking? ; Client: Well, the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and the family. Like my dad's 85, he still smokes. I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes I thought of quitting, but I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can-- I don't know if I can quit. ; Therapist: So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--? ; Client: Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking. ; Therapist: I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything. ; Client: Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned, like if this keeps going, like. ; Therapist: So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking. ; Client: So, I can actually do it that way like gradual taber? ; Therapist: There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be. ; Client: I wish my wife could have come today cause she's feels after like, just stop like right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message? ; Therapist: If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you. ; Client: Okay. I'll have to talk to her as well because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set something up. ; Therapist: Okay. That sounds good. ; Client: All right. ; Therapist: Thanks for coming in. ; Client: Okay. Thanks.",high
28,"Therapist: Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today. ; Client: Thank you, my doctor [unintelligible 00:00:05] ; Therapist: What brings you in? ; Client: Well am having, um-- I've been an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit. ; Therapist: So, you'd like to give up those cigarettes? ; Client: Oh I've been wanting to, for a long long time in years. ; Therapist: Yeah, so then it's, um, right now, uh, tell me a little bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it's so important to quit. ; Client: Well I have a 15-year-old daughter and she's highly against it. And, um, health issues, you know, I'm getting-- not getting any younger and I have asthma and I have chronic bronchi-- bronchitis and, um, I'm having a hard time breathing when I exercise and not to mention it's socially unacceptable really. ; Therapist: Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker. ; Client: Actually it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony. ; Therapist: 'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a good mum- ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: -and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke. ; Client: Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and in-in turn, it's embarrassing for me. ; Therapist: Okay. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah. ; Client: Right right, yeah. ; Therapist: So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say— ; Client: Oh and emphysema the beginning stages of emphysema. ; Therapist: Oh my goodness. Okay. And so, and that-- yeah, that's very-- that's really scary beginnings of emphysema, I'm sorry to hear that. ; Client: Thank you. ; Therapist: Well, I mean that's-that's, you know, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that. ; Client: I really couldn't tell you, um, I remember when my daughter was like five, um, I was-- it was humid out and I have a problem with humidity- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -you know, for breathing, um, and, um, I was trying to stick my head out the window to gasp for air- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -and my daughter became so frightened that she went next door to our neighbor and called 911 and it really— ; Therapist: Smart girl. ; Client: Yeah-Yeah she's very intelligent, yeah. Um, and they came they took me, you know, on this chair type of thing in my robe and my daughter was in sure panic, um, thinking she's was gonna lose me and she's 15 so its been 10 years since then and I still I've tried this Chantix- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -unsuccessfully, uh,-- ; Therapist: Tell me a little bit about what happened with the-the Chantix. ; Client: Well, um, I don't know if it's my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very bad side effects from it so. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What sort of if-if you are willing to talk about what kind of side effect— ; Client: Um, I had nightmares- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -nausea- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -um, stomach problems, and agitation. Yeah. ; Therapist: Oh really. You know, and I've heard that too, Carrie, that people especially you know those are, um, some people seem to have a lot of success but when people do have the adverse side effects they are really pronounced like the ones you just described. ; Client: Right and it didn't stop me from smoking as well, so that's, uh, [laughs]— ; Therapist: Want the good [crosstalk] no good right? And how long ago was that that you— ; Client: Um, that was about two to three years ago. ; Therapist: Okay, all right. ; Client: I tried it a couple of times. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: I would get a, um, a new prescription refilled thinking, ""Oh I could try it this time."" ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And I had friends that it worked for- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, and there is a support group that they have that you can go online or call- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -but of course I didn't do either but- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -um— ; Therapist: It just didn't fit for you to do the online. ; Client: No. Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. So, um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you-you really listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really bad things. ; Client: And agitation really- ; Therapist: Oh yeah. ; Client: -because, um, you know, um, being at my age I'm going through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think, as far as I'm concerned. ; Therapist: So, it's already piled I'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you're looking for some relief and not something to make you feel worse. ; Client: Right, exactly. ; Therapist: Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking completely? ; Client: Only when I was in the hospital. [chuckles] ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: And even then I-I snuck out and had a cigarette, you know. ; Therapist: Okay. So, what's the longest you've ever gone without a cigarette including being in the hospital? ; Client: Oh God, I would have to say, uh, three days. ; Therapist: Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I would imagine, I think that's pretty good. ; Client: But it was not really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I wasn't able to smoke so, yeah. ; Therapist: You were forced to- ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: -not smoke? ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah. ; Therapist: What did you notice during those three days when you weren't smoking? ; Client: Um, constant thoughts about smoking. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, uh, just as, um, a chocoholic craves chocolate- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -I was craving my cigarette. ; Therapist: You were [unintelligible 00:06:04] ; Client: Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um, and the first thing when I was able to smoke, I didn't care if I smoke my brand or anybody else's brand, I just wanted that cigarette. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: The nicotine is the addiction. ; Therapist: Right. ; Client: And-and also the-the psyche thing, you know, with-- I mean, I wake up in the morning, I want a coffee with- I want coffee with a cigarette. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, if I'm stressed, coffee with a cigarette. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I mean, just cigarette. Um, so it's always, like, it's-it's a duel kind of problem I think- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -you know- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -I'm finding it to be. ; Therapist: It does, uh, it does a lot of positive things for you. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And it sounds like it's paired, like a coffee and a cigarette. I mean, you know, probably hard to think about, ""How will I have a cup of coffee without a cigarette?"" ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of different things. And, um, you might already know this, and so let me know if you do, um, because of the way cigarettes you're describing it and accurately is-- it is really what we call an almost perfect drug in a lot of ways. And- ; Client: Oh, really? ; Therapist: -it will do whatever you need it to do at any given time. The downside is-is it-it kinda get, it gets in the end with the health. ; Client: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: It'll-it'll take a good usually 10 years off your life minimum. ; Client: As they say, my aunt was like, ""Put another nail in your coffin,"" you know. ; Therapist: Okay. What do you think when she says that to you? ; Client: More on kind of cocky and I say, ""Well, you know, Aunt Kathy, you were my role model, and back in the day, um, I used to envy and watch and think you were so sexy, and all the movies, the old movies."" ; Therapist: Glamourous. ; Client: Yes, yeah. And that's what I associated with at the time and now it's almost, I'm ostracized for it. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: So, it's kind of like a double-edged sword. ; Therapist: So, and I would- I would-- it really is because it wasn't like that 20 years ago. ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: It wasn't like that for sure 30 years ago. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So, it's become harder to be a smoker. You light up a cigarette-cigarette and people make assumptions about you. ; Client: Oh, yeah, and you have to travel like 10 miles- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -in order to have a cigarette. And not say you're in a situation and you only have a 15-minute break- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -you can't even finish your cigarette, um, because you have to be back within a certain amount of time and it takes you, like, let's say seven minutes to get to the place where you can smoke and seven minutes to get back- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -and a cigarette, um, for me takes five minutes to smoke. ; Therapist: Okay-okay. So—",high
65,"Client: Many people have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight. ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -if you quit smoking. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it. ; Therapist: Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then. ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: I'm wondering what else might be on that list. ; Client: Um, withdrawal. ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: They say it's awful. Um, being cranky. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping? ; Client: Um, I think everything's on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -not- going through life without smoking. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -that made me rethink- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -everything.",high
41,"Therapist: So, thank you for coming in today. ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: How are you feeling today? ; Client: I feel great actually. ; Therapist: Yeah? Good. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Good. ; Client: I feel good. ; Therapist: And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -and what are your top five? ; Client: Yes. It was a good, uh, experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and, uh, the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one. ; Therapist: Really? ; Client: Yeah. And, um— ; Therapist: Do you have any idea why that is? ; Client: I do have an idea, I think, why that is. Um, I think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family, is that I have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other people first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was, uh, kind of sad in a way, at the time that I realized it. Uh, I didn't realize how severe it actually was, but I was kind of glad that I realized it because I feel like it's never too late to change- ; Therapist: True. ; Client: -and I feel like I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better person for other people as well. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Because I get stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And I can't be the best- the best me possible. ; Therapist: For someone else? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: For your family? ; Client: For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah. ; Therapist: You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself? ; Client: I-it's almost-- Like, I think that some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other people think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values dictate my actions, I was letting what I thought other people wanted me to do to dictate my actions. ; Therapist: Wow. ; Client: And that's something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing it. ; Therapist: There's so much of your-- Part of your paradigm? ; Client: Yes, yes. ; Therapist: So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware ; Client: Not aware at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt-- I feel like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parent, and I could give myself the things that weren't given to me, now. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself an opinion. I can live like that, if I want to. Nobody's stopping me from it, only me. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: So, that's what I want to do. ; Client: Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty for saying that. ; Therapist: The very first time that you can remember? ; Client: I would say so, yeah. I don't know if I've ever said that in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles] ; Therapist: That's not a selfish thing. ; Client: No- ; Therapist: Right. ; Client: -it's not, it's really not. ; Therapist: Cool, that's great. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel? ; Client: Well, it makes me feel jubilant. It makes me feel joyful. It makes me feel hopeful. It makes me feel like I count, like I matter. Uh, it makes me feel like I'm going to be able to do what I want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the things that kind of happened along the way I really didn't notice, is that, um-- Like, let's say for example I like being a teacher or I like being a teacher or I like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all the shoulds and all of the sense of responsibility and all of the caring about what people think, I started to lose joy doing things I actually enjoy doing. ; Therapist: Because you're- felt so obligated. ; Client: Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really really a sense of like you know passion you know. My passion is gone completely. I don't know I'm just happy to, I feel like I got back in touch with myself. It's like I was like lost for a while and now I'm like back again, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do this or like why this is important to me because it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, uh, balanced. ; Therapist: Yeah, is that on your top five also ; Client: No, but um, the other ones I have on there, uh are, number two, inner harmony. For the same reason, like I feel like I need to harmonious within myself before I can be harmonious with other people. ; Therapist: You get peace with yourself? ; Client: Yes, and then I put family happiness. ; Therapist: That's very good. ; Client: Yes, because I think that when I'm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. When I am unhappy with myself, I bring my unhappiness to my family. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Client: Uh, yeah, when I don't have self-respect and I am only giving my family a say on who I am and what I should do, I'm angry at them, I quarrel them. ; Therapist: You feel resentful. ; Client: I resent them, I really do, when I am in the mode. But when I just say, ""Hey, I'm a person of this family and I deserve this much time and energy and attention and just more than anybody else,"" I don't care, you do what I do I do what I do life goes on [chuckles]. ; Therapist: Right. ; Client: And then I have health and achievement, and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier like I think I can show up and be a teacher and be a counselor in many different, uh, capacities. I could be your- I could be- I could be a teacher and I could be a really bad teacher. I could still be a teacher you know, I could show up an I could just do a really poor job and I could go home and I probably could keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right? ; Therapist: Right. ; Client: But I don't feel good about that. ; Therapist: You don't feel fulfilled. ; Client: No. ; Therapist: Like you've done anything helpful. ; Client: Right, right. ; Therapist: It's because you showed up and you gave out ; Client: It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see it going together with the helping. It's not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or do what I think I should do but to really give something needy, something substantive, something real. ; Therapist: Meaningful. ; Client: Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's small. ; Therapist: Sometimes it's the small things that really count, too. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you are right now. ; Client: Yeah. Yeah. ; Therapist: That's great and is there anything else on the list you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top five that you had or something similar? ; Client: Well, one of the things about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I have done this list, uh, creativity and freedom have been really high up there. And it didn't even make it to my top five. It was in my top 12. ; Therapist: Uh-uh. ; Client: But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and self-respect. Part of what- part of what binds me, part of what takes my freedom away is when I just explain all over the place and I don't give any attention to myself. Part of what steals my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in stress and I am not- I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative if you can't even hear yourself? ; Therapist: All the chattering. ; Client: Yeah, exactly, to me the creativity comes from the silence, comes from the quiet. It's literally-- I can just be in silence for even if for a few moments. It's amazing the ideas that come to me so quickly and so easily that would take me hours to figure out if I'm stressing. ; Therapist: Thank you so much for sharing. ; Client: Thank you, thank you for listening.",high

76,"Client: Hi. ; Therapist: Hi, Deborah. How are you doing today? ; Client: Good, I'm doing really good. ; Therapist: Yes, um, so you did do your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about that you discovered? ; Client: Yeah, I really like doing this, and, um, I-I rated health as my first- ; Therapist: Oh, so it's your first? ; Client: -uh, value. Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole package, I guess, health. Um, and I'm working on, um, a certification to become a fitness trainer. Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40] there's a like extension program. I've been doing that for the last five weeks. I have a final exam coming up, like, Saturday. A little tense about it, I guess, but, um, I'm looking forward to, like, doing it, and I gotta wait for my results. Then, I got into an internship. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, but it's kind of exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long is getting boring too-- physical activity, health, in that respect. ; Therapist: So, health being your number one, um, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior officer worker? You're doing something that you're actually living to do. ; Client: Yeah, I like being active. You know, if I could, um, be more adept to tennis, and I would love to do something like that coaching people how to play tennis, but I don't. I know enough about the game and play it, but I-I don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people but— ; Therapist: Now, have you done this sheet more than once? ; Client: Yes, I have. ; Therapist: And then, has health always been number one for you? ; Client: It's been in the top. It's been up there, yeah. I don't remember if it's always been number one. It's probably definitely been in the top three. Uh, yeah, because I've had problems, um, with inner harmony, I guess in different stages in my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it at number two. ; Therapist: Inner harmony is number two? ; Client: Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12. But then when I look at it again it had something to do with, um, peace, uh, inner peace or something or something in there. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And, um, I put that as a higher priority, or top of my value list. ; Therapist: So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life? ; Client: Yeah. Um, since I've been practicing yoga, and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that I've been, um, coming to terms with more, that I feel like I have a lot more inner harmony. I'm more at peace with myself, and in-in the quiet times, and if I'm meditating. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, I really feel like-- yeah, I feel like really good about myself. ; Therapist: So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony? That's where that comes from? ; Client: Yeah, that's part of it. Yeah, and then just feeling like, um, I don't have to please other people either. It's not a selfish thing to put myself first. And, uh, that's something I've always tried to do, make other people happy, please other people, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. And I always thought, ""Well, that's the way a good person should be.They should always put other people first, you know. And then there's times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, ""Well, my needs aren't so important right now."" I think that is okay to do once in a while. As long as you know- you know that you're not really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. And you realize, ""Well, I'm just-- I'm really helping this other person a lot, and it gives me satisfaction."" ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Not out of a sense of, uh, you know, ""I'm obligated to this person."" ; Therapist: Yes, yes, yes. So, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, and fourth. Um, it was- it was really a problem, you know, like, how could you be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself when- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self-self worth, and you know, self-- and-and dealing with- ; Client: Self love. ; Therapist: -self love. ; Client: Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. [crosstalk] And that it's not selfish. ; Therapist: Yeah that's not selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, um, just as long as it's not detrimental to yourself. It's true. ; Client: Yes. Yeah. Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other people. Being there for other people, you know, and-and if it puts myself out. Like I have my brother, his-his daughter, and his granddaughter they come over and, uh, I slept on-on the air mattress and, uh, me with my mother and my dad and my sis-- my-- his daughter in the other spare room that I have. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And I do that, but I think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that I have a guest. I could sleep in my bed all the other days. [unintelligible 00:05:54] ; Client: So, you know, even if it's a little inconvenient for me, or my house gets messy, or my kitchen is a mess, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves it's okay. You know, I'll live. You know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. Yeah. Before it was wisdom, because I really, that's, um-- it is high on my list and it might be higher if these other things weren't here. ; Client: But I like I enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the world and then just also being around people that live in the community that are from other cultures. And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. And just also being open to, uh, differences. And then like today, Election Day realizing that something might happen, uh, in the Congress or the Senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but if it happens, it happens, and I have to deal with it and-and be at peace with myself with about whatever anybody else is doing I still have to have that inner peace within myself. ; Therapist: And in the sense of you saying in your words, you'll live. ; Client: Right. Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So, live, um, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you know that you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge [unintelligible 00:07:30] values. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And learning the differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom. ; Client: Yes. And school learning in the classroom and outside of the classroom. Where I've been in different Native American communities, reservations, place I spent two months in the summertime really, uh, learning about the cultures is a beautiful place to be, there's a lot of wisdom. And, uh, fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -enjoyment. I think it's intertwined in a lot of things. It's fun to learn about pe-- other people, other cultures. it's fun to have the inner harmony. I think that- I think that was an all-encompassing thing about life. The part of it is to experience pleasure. Yeah. ; Therapist: So pleasure being your number five. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: And when I think of the flip side of that, uh, um, I-I know there's gonna be pain, disappointment, upset in my life, um, too that I accept that and that's part of joy. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: True joy comes from knowing it's not always gonna be happy. I'm gonna- I'm gonna be bummed out sometimes. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I'm gonna be disappointed, I'm gonna be injured or whatever. ; Therapist: So you've taken that into account that- ; Client: Absolutely. ; Therapist: -things may happen in life. ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah. ; Therapist: It sounds as though your list is like definitely a story. I-It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three. Uh— ; Client: Inner harmony. ; Therapist: Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow yourself to help other people or to serve-service. ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: Not being, you know, whatever you did for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't be able to find, um, problems with helping other people. And, uh, that's when service which is your number three or number four, which has been wisdom. You learning different, you know, cultures and having that broad range of-of just opening your eyes and seeing the world in a whole another scope.And then five which being pleasure, which is also okay, I do see the whole world and I know that within myself that I'm able to, you know, accept that I will have things coming out of me as far as, you know, not being, you know, uh, it's like, okay, things might happen. You're gonna get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21] ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, it was nice talking to you. ; Client: Yeah, it was nice being here and having you listen to me. Encouraging me was okay. ; Therapist: Okay.",high
123,"Therapist: Okay, I finished the exam. I have some good news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news. ; Client: That's great. ; Therapist: However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm just wondering what's going on. ; Client: I don't smoke cigarettes. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it. ; Client: Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. And we got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that-that's got tobacco in it. ; Therapist: Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that? ; Client: Really? Bad? But they're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars. ; Therapist: Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important. ; Client: Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out. ; Therapist: Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting? ; Client: Well, I didn't really know I'd started. ; Therapist: What do you mean? ; Client: I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars. ; Therapist: So you're gonna quit then? ; Client: Uh, maybe. ; Therapist: What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit. ; Client: Well, it's something that I'll have to think about. ; Therapist: What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in. ; Client: Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back. ; Therapist: Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger. ; Client: Well, I don't believe that they are cigars. And what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right, and it's something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real. ; Therapist: You're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die. ; Client: Well, it's something that I'll think about. ; Therapist: Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change.",low
131,"Therapist: Good morning. It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking. ; Client: Good morning. ; Therapist: What have you got in mind, what do you want from us? ; Client: Well, I need some medication if you can offer me some. ; Therapist: Absolutely, we're in the right place for that. ; Client: And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop. ; Client: It's, uh, just these days-- I think these days I'm-I'm finding that, um, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I'm getting sick of it. It's, you know, I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking. ; Therapist: Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here. ; Client: Especially the other night I was at the restaurant, it was a bit-- you know, it was a bit embarrassing I'm the only one walk walking out. ; Therapist: And so that-that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly and it's getting embarrassing. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Any other reasons? ; Client: Um, it's expensive these days. ; Therapist: How much does it actually cost you a week? ; Client: It's-it's about-- Um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost £7. ; Therapist: £7 a week or a day? ; Client: £7 a day today, so- ; Therapist: So your pack a day— ; Client: -you're talking about £40, uh— ; Therapist: £50 a week. ; Client: £50 a week. ; Therapist: Even more mess, you see. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. So we're talking about spending £50 a week- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Great, okay. So have you got a date in mind when you'd like to stop smoking? ; Client: Well, what you do-- What do you suggest? ; Therapist: Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it? ; Client: Um, it's just entertainment. Something, um, when I bored, it's got-- I've got-- I smoke- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -or sometimes I go out, but as I said, I'm the only one kind of outside. ; Therapist: Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about it? ; Client: The-- Um, it takes away a lot of my stresses. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses? ; Client: Just, uh, when I- when I go down, uh, for-for a break at work. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I never go down, I just need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, uh, I-I really enjoyed that. The cigarette just helps me calm down. ; Therapist: Yeah. And what is your favorite cigarette of the day? ; Client: It's definitely the one at the end of the evening. ; Therapist: Okay, so the end of the day- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette? ; Client: I guess, um, I'll just- I'll just have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a cigarette in my hand but to try and give myself regular breaks maybe, I don't know. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: It's one of those tough things. ; Therapist: Have you managed to stop smoking in the past? ; Client: I've managed for a couple of weeks. ; Therapist: Okay. And what got you back? ; Client: It was, um-- To be honest, it was stress from an argument with my partner I remember. ; Therapist: So something just happened- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and you don't really like the smell. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: The main reason that you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a little stress that's going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: What you'd like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of like choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible. When do you think would be a good time for you to choose to be your quit date? ; Client: I guess, um, at the weekend I've got a party coming up. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: So, uh, maybe Monday morning. ; Therapist: So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the things that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen people using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings? ; Client: Yeah. I'm thinking, um, one of these patches. ; Therapist: Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stopping smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chance of success four times greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's really good that you've come to see me. Now, what you said is you really want to do it and that next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party is over and done with. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette. So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you're having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with. Often, a person who smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving for a cigarette. What does it feel like to you, when you can't have a cigarette and you want one? ; Client: I just get irritable. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happening to you. ; Client: Hmm. ; Therapist: So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: So, you're happy with the date for [unintelligible 00:06:16]? ; Client: Yeah, absolutely. ; Therapist: Okay and would you like to come back and see me again? ; Client: Well, definitely. ; Therapist: And what would you like me to do if you don't come back? ; Client: A nice phone call. ; Therapist: I'd be very happy to do that.",low
106,"Therapist: Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: That's really a big problem. ; Client: Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really upset. ; Therapist: Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking? ; Client: Yeah, I-- Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him. ; Therapist: Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that? ; Client: I-I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, when he's home, I go outside to smoke. I just-- I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard. ; Therapist: I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also, things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker? ; Client: No, but I don't smoke. I'm-- I-I-I've thought about quitting, but it's just- It's really hard so I just don't know how to do it. ; Therapist: Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things- ; Client: I know, I know. I've heard-- People have told me before, I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's-it's so hard. ; Therapist: Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call. ; Client: I just don't have time for any of that. ; Therapist: There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important. ; Client: I understand that. I know it is. I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really-- It's really, really hard. ; Therapist: Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child? ; Client: I don't know. ; Therapist: I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important. ; Client: I'll-I'll-I'll go look at all those things and-and I'll find-- I guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor about it. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger. ; Client: Okay, whatever. Okay. ; Therapist: Okay.",low
