118,"Therapist: Hi, come in. [door closes] Sit- sit yourself down. Uh, what can I do for you today? ; Client: Well, I've got myself all worked up now I've been sat outside. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: I'm not-- I'm now late. I'm sorry. Um, I've come to see you because I've got a really sore throat. It's been like this for a good few days, um, and I think I need some more antibiotics. ; Therapist: All right. Um, okay. Um, well let's, uh, let's just have a look shall we? See what's going on. You just wanna open your mouth for me. Say ah. ; Client: Ah. ; Therapist: Okay. Right. Uh, to be honest, you know, looking there, it just looks like one of those viruses that are going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats. So, uh, I think that we should just perhaps go for a bit of paracetamol and, uh, some fluids and let nature sort it out. ; Client: I've been sat here for half an hour. Do you not want to know a little bit more about it, or? I mean, it- it's really painful. I- I've barely been able to swallow today and I'm so worried about passing things on to the kids. Um— ; Therapist: Well, I mean, I'm sorry we're a bit late, but you know that's the general practice, isn't it? You know, sometimes these things happen. Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it. ; Client: [sighs] Well, I mean, this is gonna affect my job. I talk on the phone quite a lot at work, and I'm just-- I don't think at the moment I'm going to be able to go to work. Can- can I, at least, get a sick note? ; Therapist: Uh, well- well, not really. Uh, you need to self-certify in your first seven days off sick so if you're going to take some time off, just take some paracetamol, lots of fluids, get a self-certified note, uh, in to your employer, and put sore throat there. ; Client: Well, I don't think my employer are gonna take that. I mean, they- they've given us so much hassle at things in the past. I mean, can- can I get a private note? Can- can I ask you to write me a letter, at least? ; Therapist: Uh, well, obviously that's a non-NHS thing so we have to charge you for that and our going rate for that is, uh, £12. ; Client: Just- it's just not good enough. I just-- [sighs] ; Therapist: Oh, I'm sorry. But, you know, if you have just got a sore throat, then there's not much I can do about that. It's just, you know, something that we all get from time to time. Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids. ; Client: Parace- paracetamol. Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be for me? I mean, I could lose my job or something. ; Therapist: Okay, that's pretty unlikely with sore throat. I think that's so, you know, a little bit of grand staging there. ; Client: I'm sorry, uh, I think I'm gonna say something that I don't- I don't want to, so I'm actually going to go. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Thank you. ; Therapist: Bye.",low
85,"Therapist: So, we were, um- we were just talking a little bit about sustained talk, which most people call denial. ; Client: Well, I'm glad I don't have any of that.[laughter] ; Therapist: You're a lucky man. ; Client: Thank you. ; Therapist: So, um, it also, um-- Anyway, it's-it's when people are just saying, ""Um, you know, this is why I don't wanna change. You know, I'm happy the way that I am. You know, it's, you know, um, God made it that marijuana stuff,"" you know, things like that. So- ; Client: Yeah, okay. ; Therapist: -so, you're gonna, um, play with me a little bit and, um- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -and you're gonna— ; Client: Well, you were asking me why I don't like to take my medicine. ; Therapist: Right. So, you're-you're a, um-um, a patient who's been diagnosed with some s- maybe schizophrenia, bipolar. ; Client: I like to call it mild schizophrenia. ; Therapist: Okay, mild schizophrenia is fine. Good. Okay, so- ; Client: And-and-and, uh— ; Therapist: -just a touch. ; Client: Yeah, just a little schizophrenia. I'm-I'm-- But, I'm okay with it, and so am I. ; Therapist: Okay. [laughs] And-and-and, uh, if you wanted to maybe even, you know, a little drinking and weed in there 'cause it's also very kind. [crosstalk] ; Client: Oh, that makes me f-- Yeah, that makes me feel- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -relaxed. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: I need that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Um- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -I gotta be relaxed, you know- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -if-if you had, you know- if you had to ride around in the back of a garbage truck all day like I do- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -uh, it's, uh- it's stressful, you know. [clears throat] But, the doctor- you know, the other doctor put me on this medicine and-and I gotta take it every day. And, I-I don't like it. Uh, I'll just be honest with you, I don't like it. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: It doesn't-- I don't like the way it makes you feel, um, I don't like the way it makes me act, and it's taken my sex drive, and just thrown it at the back of the garbage truck. ; Therapist: Well, that is a bummer. I mean— ; Client: It is. ; Therapist: So you said the-the first one you said, you don't like the way it makes you feel? ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: So, tell me a little bit about what you don't like about- what you've noticed about it? ; Client: Well, i-it's kinda like I'm in kind of a dreamy world. I-it kind of, I don't know, i-it just seems like I'm kinda like living in the middle of a cotton ball or something like that, where just things are kinda soft and, I don't know, I-- It just, the-the spice of life doesn't seem to be there. It seems like everything's bland, and nothing really-- Food doesn't taste the same, and things don't smell right, and— ; Therapist: Very dull. ; Client: Very dull. ; Therapist: Very dull. ; Client: Very dull. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good. ; Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that. ; Client: Well, I feel like it's taken part of my personality and just thrown it away. I don't really feel like I'm all there, right. You know, like, um, I like to be spontaneous and funny, and-and all that night, and I- and I don't-- You know, by the time I come up with a-a funny remark to the situation, everybody's left the room, and-[laughter]-stuff like that. And-and-- [chuckles] ; Therapist: It's really, your timing is [unintelligible 00:03:13] ; Client: Absolutely. ; Therapist: So you feel slow. ; Client: And so, as you can can tell, I didn't take my medication today, I'm-I'm-I'm really on my game today. So. ; Therapist: So, it's, you know, thinking as quickly and responding as quickly and-and things like that-- [crosstalk] ; Client: More like takes the edge off- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -for sure. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Well, you understand that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: You-you can- you can understand why I don't take it. ; Therapist: To tell you, it sounds terrible, actually. Yeah. So, that that-that really-- And then- and then, to top it all off, literally, I mean, no sex drive. ; Client: Right-right. ; Therapist: And-and your wife, what does she have to say about that? ; Client: Well, she wants to know who I am and what did I do with her husband. ; Therapist: Yeah. Where's Scott? Where did- where did Scott go? That feisty, spirited guy, where- where'd he go? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: With the libido out the door. ; Client: Yeah. And, uh- and so, she-- Actually, she-- When I first went on the medicine, she thought I was maybe messing around with somebody else, 'cause, I-I just wasn't interested in it at all. ; Therapist: Oh, okay. ; Client: I canceled my subscription to the spice channel. ; Therapist: I didn't even know they had a spice channel. [chuckles] ; Client: I don't know if they still have it or not. [chuckles] ; Therapist: So they-- So, um, before you started taking the medication, though, when she was, you know, um-- Even though now she's like, ""Where is my old Scott,"" and stuff, well, were there any times when she wanted you to go on the medication? And, if so, what-what prompted those? ; Client: Well, if I stay off the medication too long, I-- Some people might say there's a problem with that, you know. ; Therapist: You were right. ; Client: Well, I guess running around the neighborhood with no clothes on isn't really good. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Um, I thought I had a, uh— ; Therapist: Might get you into trouble [unintelligible 00:05:06] ; Client: Yeah, well, I thought I had my gym shorts on, but they said that I didn't. ; Therapist: Okay. What else? ; Client: Well, I-I ended up in the hospital. ; Therapist: What do you think about the hospital? ; Client: Don't like that hospital. ; Therapist: No. ; Client: Uh. [clears throat] I'm not sure that the hospital is worse than the cotton ball, but I don't like it either. ; Therapist: So, you'd really like to stay out of that hospital? ; Client: Well, I got a question for you. You're a doctor, why don't you guys come up with some- something else besides either being in the hospital or taking this stuff every day, can you come up with something? I mean, you guys, we put a man on the moon 50 years ago, I mean, and you still got to give me this stuff that makes me feel like a-a zombie with-- That hasn't had a drink or water in four days, it-it just doesn't seem right. Either you guys ought to come up with something better. That's what I think. ; Therapist: I agree with you, I really do. So-- And I- and I think that a lot of times, um, the medications, they do have a lot of side effects, and I completely understand why people don't wanna take them- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yet, at the same time, I know running around and getting in trouble for being naked or having to go to the hospital, not such a good thing either. Um, I'm wondering if, um- if I could run some ideas by you that some other patients of mine have tried? ; Client: I suppose. ; Therapist: Okay, thanks. Um, we could if you're-- 'Cause, as you can tell, this is really more of an art than a science, um, try some other medications and see how you do on them, and perhaps, you won't have these side effects. And, um, it-it really is just a matter of kind of experimenting around to get, uh, to see if we can get to a point that at least you're not having these really bad things happen of getting into the hospital and getting arrested and stuff versus feeling more like that-that spirited Scott that, you know, watches Spice channel, you know, I mean-- Because I can tell the spirit of Scott is, uh, a hoot. ; Client: Well. Yeah. Well, yeah, I-I'd like to. I don't know, is it-- Can you- can you drink with them, some of these other ones? ; Therapist: Well, you know, uh, Scott, well, tell me a little bit since you brought that up. Yeah, obviously, drink and tell me a little bit about your [unintelligible 00:07:35] ; Client: Well, I don't really drink like people-- Like some alcoholic or something but, I do— ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I-I like to take the edge off- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: You know, with a few drinks, you know, not-not a lot, you know, and-and really- ; Therapist: How-how often do you do that? ; Client: Not every day. ; Therapist: Maybe every other day? ; Client: Maybe. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Maybe not, uh- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: You know, it's not all the time, it's-it's not- it's not a problem. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Certainly not a problem. ; Therapist: How would you know if it was a problem? ; Client: Well, if I was like getting arrested for drunk driving. ; Therapist: So, if you got a DUI, you would really know. ; Client: Well, that's what alcoholics do. I'm not an alcoholic. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine. ; Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway. ; Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem. ; Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it? ; Client: I get edgy. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: I-I-I get edgy. ; Therapist: Yeah. And you don't like that? ; Client: No-no. I'd-I'd like to just be normal as well. I'd real-- I'd like to just be normal where I don't have to take medicine, and I don't end up in the hospital three times a year, and I don't find myself in the neighbor's yard— ; Therapist: Running around naked. ; Client: With a statue. It's— ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: They were really ticked about that statue thing this time, and I don't know why I keep going back over there, but— ; Therapist: You must like that statue. ; Client: I really don't, but, apparently, when I'm in that state, uh, there's something about it, I'm not sure. ; Therapist: So, if-if-if we could maybe find a medication that didn't give you as bad side effects, perhaps you might not have to drink as much or at all or smoke a little weed to take the edge off. I mean, who knows? [unintelligible 00:09:55] ; Client: Well, maybe. I-I-I guess that's possible. ; Therapist: Yeah.",high
31,"Therapist: Hi Mr. Johnson? ; Client: Hey. ; Therapist: Hi, I'm Tonny Brownie, I'm a pharmacist here, uh, and I- and I was wanting to spend just a little time with you talking to you about your cholesterol. I found out you're newly diagnosed and your medicine for your cholesterol. ; Client: Yeah, my doctor talked to me about my cholesterol, that-that's-that's his job. ; Therapist: Okay, certainly glad to hear that your doctor did spend some time with you, um, I-I see myself as somebody who works with your doctor, uh, to help you get the most benefit from your medicine, uh, because you are gonna spend money on it we wanna make sure that you get the most benefit from it. Uh, also sometimes it may be difficult to reach your doctor we're also here, uh, and so we try to work together, wo-would that be okay? ; Client: Yeah, that'd be okay, yeah, you know, I'm not so certain I'm even gonna take the medicine cause, you know, he mentioned muscle weakness, uh, you know, I-I know I got high cholesterol, uh, and that I'm running the risk of stroke and heart attack down line but yeah, he mentioned muscle weakness and I've been thinking about that and, uh, you know I'm a truck driver and I got a haul the heavy boxes out of the truck on a dolly, and I can't afford that right now. Just that-that muscle weakness, uh, that-that bothers me. ; Therapist: So-so on the one hand, the doctor talked to you about high cholesterol, down the line possibly causing a stroke or heart attack- ; Client: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: -and that would be pretty serious. On the other hand, uh, when you found out that this drug might cause muscle weakness, that really alarmed you. ; Client: Yeah, that's the problem, that's what I face now with my job. ; Therapist: Especially with your job and- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -preventing you from doing your livelihood. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay, um, would you mind if I talk to you, if-if I- if I gave you a little bit of information about the muscle weakness, and you tell me what you think? ; Client: That'd be fine. ; Therapist: Okay. The muscle weakness with this drug is very rare, uh, usually doesn't even happen, okay? Uh, if it happens it usually happens within the first month of taking the medicine, you'll notice it in terms of weakness in the arms, uh, or some muscle pain, it's not usual. If this should happen, uh, if you let the doctor or me know right away, we can get you off the medicine, it's completely reversible. It's, the muscle weakness will go away within a couple of days, right. ; Client: Oh. ; Therapist: Now, you don't wanna let that go on for months at a time, that's when it can become serious. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: But otherwise, again it's rare, and it's completely reversible if you let us know. ; Client: Well, I guess it doesn't worry me quite as much if it's reversible like that. You know, I was thinking this was gonna be a big-time, but, uh, uh, yeah, I guess, it sounds manageable. ; Therapist: Okay, and, uh, so talk to me a little bit more about what the doctors told you about-about your risks of stroke or heart attack while you're ta- while you have high cholesterol. ; Client: Oh, he just said that the risks are-are up, I think he called it elevated but, uh, you know, uh, that I'm at a higher risk of having a stroke or a heart attack down the line, uh, you know, that's down the line. ; Therapist: Okay, well how important would it be for you to-to, uh, do whatever you can to reduce your risks of stroke or heart attack down the line? ; Client: Well, you know, my wife and I wanna retire in about four to five years and we wanna be really active visiting all sorts of places, The Fjords, Norway, things like that so I-I guess having a stroke or a heart attack would really be bad for that so and, you know, we-we-we wanna live our dreams actively. ; Therapist: Yeah, and-and one of the- certainly one of the risks of stroke is paralysis, and if you wanna be active that could be- ; Client: Whoa. ; Therapist: -really a problem. ; Client: Yeah, no-no we-we wanna able to be very active. ; Therapist: Okay, well this medicine can really help lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack so that five years so now when you do retire you can enjoy it without any disability, uh, what are your thoughts about that? ; Client: Well, uh, I guess that's the-the way to go then cause I-I don't wanna be, you know, crippled by a stroke or a heart attack- ; Therapist: Sure. ; Client: -so take- taking the medicine sounds like the-the end of the game right now. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm, yeah it would, I-I-I think that would, uh, go a long way toward reducing those risks. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, um, so if so where we are right now if I understand is you're feeling more comfortable about the concern about muscle weakness? ; Client: Oh yeah. ; Therapist: Uh, you seem fairly committed to taking the medicine to reduce your risk so that you can enjoy your retirement. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Uh, and so at this point, you're gonna get the medication and- ; Client: And the medicine can get my cholesterol down? ; Therapist: Definitely, can lower your cholesterol to 50%. ; Client: Wow, okay. ; Therapist: So it's pretty effective. ; Client: Yeah, I'll take the medicine. ; Therapist: Okay, um, and at some other point we can talk about some other things that you may be able to do including diet, changes in your eating habits, it can lower your cholesterol even more. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay? ; Client: That'd be fine. ; Therapist: All right, uh, well they have your medication ready, and, uh, if you have any questions let us know. ; Client: Fair enough, hey thanks. ; Therapist: All right, good to meet you. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay.",high
127,"Therapist: So, where you said you'd like to start, Sal, is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other. ; Client: Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, my asthma has just been out of control lately and my doctor says that might be connected to Oscar. ; Therapist: Hmm. So, what- can you let me know or-or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse? ; Client: Um, I've got allergy testing. It's just, uh, the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -that's cut down. Um, and then they said the drinking might contribute to it, too. So, I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know. ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Client: The drinking, the smoking and the dust that I got, the, um, the scratch test for. ; Therapist: Right. ; Client: And-and-and that's what I know, and that I take the medicine for it. ; Therapist: Okay. And that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern? ; Client: No, I've had it for-for 12 years and now it's a concern. I don't understand. ; Therapist: Hmm. Yeah. And I-I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes. You've almost quit smoking. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You're just down to your last couple of cigarettes- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and you're not even smoking those in the house. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So, your house is totally smoke-free. ; Client: Yes, just that work with the [unintelligible 00:01:24]. ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. And you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and-and I think you mentioned done-done a little bit towards that. ; Client: Mm-hmm. I'm a little I'm a couple of down. I used to drink four at night, now I'm down to three at least. ; Therapist: Okay, okay. ; Client: Uh-huh. ; Therapist: So now almost like that's not good enough, like now you have to, now it's the dog and now- ; Client: Mm-hmm, what's next, yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: -what's next. Right. Okay. So, I mean, there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar, you know, when he's in the house or-or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him, what happens with your asthma symptoms? ; Client: Well, we keep them clean, like he's cleaned. So, all the dander doesn't really make sense, but I have been noticing that sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside, I wheeze a little bit, but I think it has to do with, um, the hair, the, in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: So, I don't know if it's that-that's where I'm confused. I don't know how this could be happening. ; Therapist: Hmm. So, it doesn't make total sense to you that-that it's all Oscar's fault and that- ; Client: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: That's that the only solution. ; Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit. ; Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long. ; Client: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. I just want some medicine and I want to keep Oscar and I wanna feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life and it honestly feels like my-my nose is just above the water. ; Therapist: Hmm. Yeah. And-and in the end, you know, whatever you- whatever you do, about Oscar, about your asthma, about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda-setting worksheet, I mean, you are in the driver's seat solid. It really is your choice. ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, that feels good. That I, you know, at least it is my choice. I just feel like just about, I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up. Um, and I'm kind of sad about things. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And I don't know, I don't know what to do. ; Therapist: There's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife, with the new baby. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: And now thinking about, looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby. ; Client: Mm-hmm. I want- I want John Carlos to grow up with Oscar. So he has his friend when he's young, too. And, um, I just, it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you-you gotta think about then, um, I'm not feeling good about it. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm, so what-what would need to happen or how would you know, when you- when or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not? ; Client: Man, uh, how would I know? I don't know. I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine- she gave me the strongest medicine and it wasn't working. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: That would be the way right now 'cause I can't see, I don't know how I'm going to give this dog up. ; Therapist: Yeah and I get the feeling that it's something that you wanna think about that this is a really big decision- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry. ; Client: No, no. It's something I got to just sit there and-and kind of, um, put the pros and the cons on the table about, but- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -something's going on.",high
92,"Therapist: Hi, are you Julie Thompson? ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah. ; Therapist: Hi, I'm Bruce Berger, I work in the clinic. I know you're here to pick up a prescription today. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Um, I noticed, uh, we noticed some of your records that, uh, you've been coming in and getting Sarah's resc-rescue inhaler for her asthma quite frequently, and you haven't got a chronic inhaler for quite some time now. I also know she has been in the emergency room several times this year. Is-- can you tell me what's going on there? ; Client: Well, I did a research on the chronic inhaler, and I saw that there were steroids in it, and I do not want my daughter taking steroids. I read about all the side effects of steroids and all the potential health problems. I don't want her taking them, and I just want to tell you right up front, I do not want to hear anything about the fact that I do smoke. Um, I smoke outside, I smoke away from her. I do not ever do it around her. So I do not want to hear about that. ; Therapist: Well, I-I need to tell you that the-the medicine that she's taking, the chronic inhaler, which is really essential to controlling her asthma does-- is not a steroid like you're thinking. It's-it's much safer, it's very safe, she-- and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control, and I also want to tell you that, uh, your smoking does affect her asthma, even if- even if it's outside, it gets on her clothes, and to be honest, I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway. But, uh, if you want to keep her out of the emergency room, she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day, and you need to watch your smoking. ; Client: Okay, I-I am not going to allow her to take any kind of steroid. I am not going to allow that to happen. She's my daughter. She's my responsibility, and I'm not going to allow that to happen, and I absolutely make sure that the smoking does not affect her. ; Therapist: Okay, I, you know, I-I don't want to argue with you about this. I-I know that if you-you know, and if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room, uh, I-I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying. She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up. So she really needs to use that chronic inhaler, and you really need to think about quitting smoking. ; Client: Fine. I'm in a really big hurry, and I need to get those prescriptions filled as soon as possible, please. ; Therapist: Okay, well, I-I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about her using that chronic inhaler, and I hope you consider quitting smoking. ; Client: Fine. I just need to get my prescriptions. ; Therapist: Okay.",low

But, um, I did look at-- there's the YMCA, they've got some classes that I think will be pretty cool to go to, and then there's this yoga class over at the Women's Center that's only like 10 bucks, so I could do that, um-- but I didn't go because I'm really afraid that like what if-- you know, what if no-one likes me? What if I don't have friends in there? ; Therapist: Yeah, I know you've mentioned that in the past. When we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -you really mentioned that anxiety- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -is a big con. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: I remember that. ; Client: Yeah, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because this is what I need to do to make-- you know, to make friends. ; Therapist: Okay.

Um, would it be okay if I do share you what will happen if you don't charge your battery. ; Client: Sure. I'll listen. ; Therapist: Um, you will be getting violations for that, and then if you get so many violations, I mean, we'd have to write a warrant for your arrest, which is looking more of, um, detention time. ; Client: Whatever. ; Therapist: And that's still doesn't seem to bother you. ; Client: No. I just-- I don't care. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: It really [unintelligible 00:00:58]-- I don't care. ; Therapist: Um, so I know that you, you know, you know the consequences of it, and yet you're sharing with me it's just not a priority for you at this time. ; Client: Nope. ; Therapist: Okay.

29,"Therapist: So you shared that you're, um, here today because you're having some dissatisfaction with your body and your confidence and your mood and your energy. And you're looking for, um, some different patterns to kind of turn things around for yourself. And what I like to do as I get to know clients is-is let them know a little bit about my philosophies, about health and wellbeing. Um, but first, I'd love to hear what are your philosophies about health and wellbeing? ; Client: Um, I definitely, uh, you know, I-I strive to be physically healthy, but I also have in my life seeing how that impacts me mentally. Um, so I think if I'm- if I'm able to do the things that I wanna do and, um, you know, that I'm feeling good about where I'm at mentally, then that's kind of my end goal, always. Um, yeah, so this body dissatisfaction piece has really just kinda thrown a wrench in that and it's been enough of a challenge that I thought I should seek out someone who can really help me through that piece. ; Therapist: Yeah. Well, I'm so glad that you reached out for help, um, and just know that you're not alone. And-and so, yeah, is that okay if I share a little bit about, um, how I tend to work with clients on that topic? ; Client: Yes, please. ; Therapist: Yeah. Well, um, first of all, I really am passionate about looking at the whole picture, um, physical health and emotional wellbeing and what I found in working with clients in the past is when, um, we make a focus of weight loss, sometimes, uh, physical health improves, but at the cost of emotional wellbeing. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Um, many people find that when then- when they are restricting their intake or starting some, uh, ac-activity patterns that are really rigorous, that, um, a piece of their mental health suffers because they start to obsess, um, more than they'd like to be about those things. So, my approach with clients is just a more holistic approach. Looking at certainly some behavior changes that you could make to be more physically active, improve your energy levels. ; Therapist: Um, and also look at activities that enhance your mood. We can also take a look at some dietary patterns and see if-if there are ways you could tweak how you're fueling your body throughout the day, but at the same time, sort of letting go of what happens on the scale. Letting go of, um, the final, you know, weight outcome of that, and really focusing instead on healing your relationship with food and also adopting sustainable physical activity patterns. What do you make of all that? ; Client: So, like, for example, having like a-a set out meal plan, um, you know, where I'm eating certain food groups or certain macronutrients, for example, that wouldn't necessarily follow that same approach. ; Therapist: Yeah, I-I found in the past when working with clients that creating a prescriptive meal plan, um, tends to work for a few days, but then clients usually get really tired of the foods on there. Um, and so instead, I'm really more interested in equipping you to learn how to space your meals and snacks out in a way that makes your body feel energized. Um, and then I can also support you, you know, in looking at the grocery shopping patterns and the meal planning patterns that come alongside all of that. Um, so really teaching you how to do more of your own meal planning, um, to fuel your body in a way that gives you energy, but also in a way where you're really still enjoying food. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Food is meant to be enjoyed, and it's a source of pleasure. So I'd want to help you certainly look for ways to add more fruits and vegetables and-and things that nourish your body, but also look for ways to add pleasure- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -to your meals and snacks. ; Client: Okay, yeah. ; Therapist: Think about all of that. ; Client: Well, I think it makes sense, especially like-like you said, to be sustainable. Um, yeah, I definitely wouldn't wanna try something where I'm going to crash and burn for days in. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Um, when you talk about activity and you mentioned like really, um, like rigorous activity types, um, like I go to a gym and I enjoy going to the gym when I was active. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, would that be kind of against that philosophy too or I guess, can you explain that a bit more? ; Therapist: Yeah, I'm all about trying to help you figure out what types of physical activity bring you the most joy because those are the things that you'll make time for. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: So if-if the gym is what brings you the most joy, then we can work with that, but if you, um, start to think about it and discover there other activities that you're more excited to attend and you're more, um, you're looking at rear-rearranging your schedule too because you really want to be there- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -um, then we can pursue those things. So it's really just about what brings you joy in terms of how you move your body and I'm just here to help you figure that out. ; Client: Cool, so both with the foods and the activity, we would be working to find things that I like to do- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -that I could do for longer periods versus more of like you said, the prescriptive approach. ; Therapist: Exactly. Yeah. So helping you find changes that feel sustainable because they bring you both nourishment health, but also pleasure. ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, I think that-that all sounds good. Um, you know, I still would want to lose weight. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, and I know you said weight loss isn't really the goal, so I- ; Therapist: Sure. ; Client: -I just want to be upfront about that part with me and maybe that changes or maybe it doesn't, but what do you think about that. ; Therapist: Absolutely, I appreciate you sharing that piece with me and you absolutely get to have that desire. And, um, we certainly are bombarded all day long with messages about how a body is supposed to look and so we all, um, certainly have moments of feeling dissatisfied with how our bodies look. And so you're absolutely, um, welcome to hold that and we can have space for that and you can certainly talk about that in these sessions. And I'll check in with you as we're going through the process of behavior change, um, to see how your body confidence is, um, as we talk more. ; Client: Great. Yeah, now that sounds good. ; Therapist: Fantastic. Thanks, Natalie.",high
2,"Therapist: Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going? ; Client: Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back. ; Therapist: Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further? ; Client: No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it. ; Therapist: All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds. ; Client: I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up. ; Therapist: But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight. ; Client: I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back. ; Client: Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it. ; Therapist: And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have? ; Client: To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner. ; Therapist: John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola? ; Client: No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving? ; Therapist: You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression? ; Client: Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter. ; Therapist: Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in? ; Client: Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ. ; Therapist: Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in. ; Client: Um, six or seven. ; Therapist: All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero? ; Client: I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight. ; Therapist: So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively? ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9? ; Client: Getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it. My wife does the shopping for us, so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice, that would solve it. ; Therapist: Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do? ; Client: I suppose I could replace it with, um, a low-calorie drink or drink more water. ; Therapist: Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me? ; Client: I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with, um, sugar-free drinks. ; Therapist: Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen? ; Client: A 10. ; Therapist: I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think? ; Client: Great. It sounds good to me. ; Therapist: Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks. ; Client: Okay.",high

I had kind of a schedule, um— ; Therapist: That's really a lot. Very good. ; Client: Yeah, well, you know, it really-- At-at one time, I was running-- I ran a half marathon. I was really into it, and, uh--. ; Therapist: Wow. ; Client: Well, and I-- But I was working at a different company, where I had a little bit different schedule, a little more free time than I have now, so I just don't have the time like I used to. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And I-- And really, it's kind of an excuse, I guess, cause I-I could probably make the time, but it's-it's easier to just keep working or- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -just being in bed or whatever. ; Therapist: But that goal of the half-marathon, you know, it's really important that you were willing to put all the time into getting ready for it, which, from what I've heard from other people, is almost like a job in and of itself. ; Client: I-it was. A-and it was huge for me cause I'd never really been a runner, you know, but it-it was very motivating, and-and— ; Therapist: What'd you like about it? ; Client: I don't know. I guess there's kind of an adrenaline rush to it. Kinda almost like, you know, uh, kind of a high, I guess. ; Therapist: Uh-huh. ; Client: So yeah-- That's-- I-I really enjoyed it. And I-I liked the feeling that I was doing something good for myself. I liked that, too. I-it kind of-- It so-- It gave me a little bit of self-esteem, I guess. ; Therapist: I-it a-almost, um, feels like you identified as being a runner, like an athlete? ; Client: I-I subscribed to the magazine a while. ; Therapist: Do you really? ; Client: I did. ; Therapist: [unintelligible 00:01:40] ; Client: I let-- I lit it on fire but I- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -I did burn for a time. ; Therapist: Got into the culture? ; Client: I got into the whole culture. I was-- I-I felt as good as I’ve felt in many, many years. And now I’ve kind of let that all slide, and-- Well, I had a foot injury, too, which kind of started the whole problem. ; Therapist: Okay, alright. Cause it’s tough, it's really, it is. I mean I’ve, um, I’m sure you’ve been told before by whomever, uh, diagnosed your foot injury, but if not, let me know if it gets so tough on your body [unintelligible 00:02:10] let me know. So-- ; Client: It-it is. And I-- it-it may be why I can’t really run again, but I can certainly, you know, ride a stationary bike- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -and do all the other things in a gym that you can do when you’re not running, so, it just nakes you to [unintelligible 00:02:23] ; Therapist: Oh, and yet and at the same time you know your body well enough, and you-you’re willing to pay attention to your doctor’s advice about the running, right now, for you, not the best thing. Um, so, riding a stationary bike. Um, what else do you like to do that's cardiovascular? ; Client: Um, well, um, I like-- The bike is pretty good. Uh, even the uh, you know, the kind of a rolling machine is okay. And the uh, the elliptical. Any of that’s fine. I-I really don’t, uh-- I don’t dislike any of it. Kind of once you get into the rhythm, yeah, it’s fine ; Therapist: If you were to pick one of those, which one do you enjoy the most, um, would be most likely to do? ; Client: Probably the elliptical. ; Therapist: The elliptical. Okay. Yeah. [unintelligible 00:03:07] like kind of almost like running. ; Client: Well, it is. ; Therapist: [chuckles]. ; Client: It is without any of the impact, so it is true. ; Therapist: Okay. And-and what do you- do you-- Some folks, you know, [unintelligible 00:03:18] put on music, kind of- kind of. ; Client: Yeah, I do headphones. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: I got my headphones, and I got my, uh, kind of [unintelligible 00:03:24], if you know what I mean ; Therapist: Okay. Get your rocking out, running on the elliptical playlist. ; Client: Yeah ; Therapist: And, um, so you were-- You said that you’ve been going several times a week, which is really an extraordinary number, I-I think it’s four, five times a week? ; Client: Yeah. I was going literally every other day, you know. And then, some days I would, you know, I’d run, and I’d go to the gym the next day, so I would-- I was very-- I don’t really feel it necessary to get back to that level, but I need to do something cause I’m doing nothing right now. ; Therapist: Nothing. Okay. ; Client: I should-- Or next to nothing. I walk to the grocery store or whatever’s handy when I have time, but yeah. ; Therapist: So what ideas do you have about initially just getting started, and what-what would you do [unintelligible 00:04:13] ? ; Client: Well, if I could just get myself over there once, 'cause usually that’s the hardest thing. It’s just going there. So I think that's-- You know, I’ve thought about it a little bit, I think I just need to make that first trip over there and just kind of to take it easy that first time. Just show up 'cause I think that’s really what I need to do. I justt need to go over there. ; Therapist: What would help you do that? ; Client: Um, knowing that my schedule isn’t gonna be too crazy that day where I could spare an hour or so, and-and just go do it. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And then I-- [unintelligible 00:04:41] kinda nice [unintelligible 00:4:42] gonna be troublesome. ; Therapist: [unintelligible 00:04:45]? ; Client: Um, I don’t know. I think- I think the time has just been the biggest thing, you know, and-and I-I guess the motivation really hasn’t been there. I mean, you know, it’s not like- I don’t really have a goal. I don’t really have a, you know I don't, other than maybe reducing my waistline, you know, I don't really have a-a set number like I'm gonna run a marathon and you know. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: You know, so I think the just running off the playlist. I-I guess maybe if I made a goal would helped too. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm- mm-hmm. So that-that-that half marathon was, uh, a very specific concrete thing and you could envision yourself, and you're ready for it and the day of and all that kinda stuff. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Um. ; Client: Plus there's people who have done that countless times and you can go read what their- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -regimen was so you get feedback too. And then [unintelligible 00:05:37] did this from this day and so on. ; Therapist: So sometimes-- almost sounds like, um, your feedback would be, uh, useful to you. Like some immediate feedback in terms of like, um, like [inaudible 00:05:53] ; Client: Yeah. Maybe. ; Therapist: [inaudible 00:05:55] ; Client: That might not be be a bad idea. [inaudible 00:05:59] ; Therapist: [inaudible 00:06:01] ; Therapist: -somebody there and, you know, hooking up with somebody. ; Client: I think that'd be great. I-I never have really found anybody that like to exercise with the pace that I wanted to. They were all either going way too fast or not even moving at all. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: So it's kinda hard to meet up with somebody that can kind of maybe kind of give you a push [unintelligible 00:06:38]- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -might be a challenge. ; Therapist: There might be something [unintelligible 00:06:43] because you're such a social guy. And so to be able to be exercising and be talking and enjoying yourself- you like the music too, right? ; Client: Yeah, that's right, well I- ; Therapist: And if you arrange to meet somebody there, you're very good at, uh, you know, uh, keeping the agreement. ; Client: Okay, that's a great idea I hadn't thought of that-that's- I hadn't really, uh, I-I kinda dismissed that early on, I hadn't really even considered that, yeah. ; Therapist: And in for right now it just be, you'll be happy with getting there one time. ; Client: If I could get there-- I know if I could get there-- if I could pick, you know, uh, these are the days I'm going to go to the gym and I know these things last time. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: So if I- if I could-- I mean, I wanna get there three times a week. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I wanna get there on Saturdays or Sundays and Tuesdays and Fridays, or something like that, then I could probably [unintelligible 00:07:34] ; Therapist: And days that you know of on your less rigorous schedule that you're more likely to succeed [unintelligible 00:07:40] I really like how you're picking like three days a week instead of some days a week. ; Client: Right, yeah. Well, it's just not- ; Therapist: Very clear you understand the whole idea of giving yourself a day off in between. ; Client: Oh yeah, yeah, it doesn't do any good to just try to injure your- injure yourself especially when you're a bit normal like me. ; Therapist: Okay, yeah, I know that, yeah, yeah.

They're really-- They have me doing some leg things that-that-that is it really necessary? ; Therapist: Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: But what are your goals for the long term? ; Client: I wanna go home. ; Therapist: Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home? ; Client: Everything. I wanna- I wanna, play with my dog. I miss my dog. I wanna cook for myself. I'm a very independent person and I wanna do things for myself. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there? ; Client: Um, I guess the rehab. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like? ; Client: Not really. ; Therapist: Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you? ; Client: Oh, yeah. ; Therapist: You've heard of it? ; Client: Uh, I have. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: I have a friend who, uh, does it and she just raves about it. She loves it. ; Therapist: Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road. ; Client: Absolutely. I do not want to fall, for sure. ; Therapist: So what do you think about Tai Chi? Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime? ; Client: Well, I-I hadn't really thought about it, but yeah I guess, I guess. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Like I said, my friend talks about it and-and it's very pretty. I've seen pictures, you know. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that easy to get started. You do certainly have to have some motivation to want to do it. Um, and when you first start, oftentimes you do feel a little wobbly or a little insecure. ; Client: Well, I don't see how I could do it. I-I'm still in a walker, you know. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, I understand. So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair. ; Client: I could? ; Therapist: You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own. ; Client: And you really recommend this? ; Therapist: You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that. ; Client: You do Tai Chi? ; Therapist: I do Tai Chi. I do it three days a week and it's really helped my balance as well. ; Client: Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Um, listen, anything that's going to get me home and if you do it and you recommend it, I'll try it. ; Therapist: All right. Well, I'm delighted. It's a pleasure to see you again. I hope your rehab continues to go well and we can talk some more about this at our next visit. ; Client: Okay, okay. ; Therapist: All right. Thank you for coming in.",high
124,"Therapist: Okay. So what ideas do you have, Natalie for, um, getting started in adding more physical activity? ; Client: Well, I think, um, like when I was really active in the past, I enjoy going to the gym and I like that regardless of what's happening with the weather outside, that-that's always an option. Um, so I've kind of already started to look and see, like, how much gym memberships cost in the area. Um, I really like one that's like month to month and doesn't require me to pay out for like a year because, in the summertime, I just don't use that when the weather is nice, I like to be outside. ; Client: So, um, I do think that that would be an option. Um, I did enjoy doing yoga in the past. I, um, I don't care for swimming, uh, because it requires a lot of extra prep time, and like, I don't- chlorine in my hair just doesn't really go very well usually. Um, but I really like walking, um, weightlifting, running is okay. Um, that was more at my, like, peak activity level, so I don't think I could start out running now, but I'd like to work up to it. ; Therapist: Great. It sounds like there are a lot of activities that you do like- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and I'm hearing a theme of climate control, [chuckles] being important to you and you've already been researching gyms. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Tell me more about that. ; Client: Yeah. So I just- on my phone, if I'm like in the grocery store, I'm kind of just looking through, and on Google, I'll type in like ""Gyms in the area"" and I'll look and see what's there. And, um, I don't ever want to sign up to learn more 'cause I feel like then they just keep emailing you forever. So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me. Just like I mentioned, I don't want to be paying for six months or a year out. ; Therapist: Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And I completely agree [laughs]about wanting to avoid the sales pitch- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step? ; Client: Yeah, I think, um, you know, I've kind of looked around and seen what I- what's available to me. Um, I think the next step would be to maybe go visit one place and just see, like, what equipment they have. Um, I also think too, I'd like to be outside when the weather permits. I like to walk. I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable. So if there is, uh, decent weather, I think going outside and, you know, getting some steps in or just walking would be a good first start for me. ; Therapist: Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting. ; Client: Right. Yeah. ; Therapist: I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that? ; Client: Sure. Yeah. ; Therapist: I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms. Uh, is that one that you have an interest in or have looked at already? ; Client: I don't know that I've looked closely at that. I don't know much about their pricing or anything like that. ; Therapist: Yes. And honestly, I don't either. [chuckles] I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms. ; Client: I agree. ; Therapist: So something to look into if you're interested. ; Client: Yeah, definitely. ; Therapist: And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and to build some confidence in that conversation. ; Client: Yeah, no, yeah. That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out. ; Therapist: Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -or the perfect gym? ; Client: Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all. ; Therapist: Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all? ; Client: Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it. ; Therapist: That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound? ; Client: No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting. ; Therapist: Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started. ; Client: Yeah, I think so. ; Therapist: Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals? ; Client: I think I'm at a 10. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Yeah. I think that, like I said, I think I'll find ways to walk. Um, and I'm at a point now where I've done as much research, I've found out as much information, I think, as I can on the gyms that are local here. Um, but I will check out the- the Y to see if it maybe is a bit cheaper and also a bit more, like, welcoming and doesn't require a- like, a six-month contract or anything like that. So I feel like those would both be good starts. Yeah. ; Therapist: Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through? ; Client: Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like- ; Therapist: Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside. ; Client: Yeah, but hopefully there's one. So, yeah. ; Therapist: Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general. And, uh, today we've talked about a small-small step to get started and you're hoping to experience some mood boost and some energy as you get rolling here. Um, how are you feeling about today's session? ; Client: No, I feel really good. I think even coming in, I didn't have a like step-by-step idea of what I wanted to do next, but no, this has been helpful to know what those small steps are, and like you said, hopefully, I do start feeling better. Yeah. ; Therapist: Great. Well, I look forward to checking in with you, and thanks so much for coming in. ; Client: Thanks for having me. All right.",high
107,"Therapist: Well, let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself. ; Client: Um, pretty obvious [chuckles]. ; Therapist: So, what happened. So first of all, tell me what you did, exactly. ; Client: What do you mean what I did? ; Therapist: Well, I mean, where did you cut yourself? I know you said you cut yourself when you- ; Client: That's the same as always. Same as always. ; Therapist: Like your arm? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: What did you cut yourself with? ; Client: A razor? ; Therapist: How deep? ; Client: Do you wanna see it? ; Therapist: Yeah. Let me see. You know those look to me like they-they-- did you go to the-- It doesn't look like you went and got any stitches, but that looks to me like you could have used them. What do you think? ; Client: I think have you ever been to an ER when you cut yourself, you'd know why I don't go. ; Therapist: Okay, but part of the problem is those look deep and like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future, if you do it, is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how, um, how this happened. First of all, tell me, you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die. But, um, did you-- Was this a suicide attempt or do you think it was just-just a cutting? Were thinking of killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die when you did it? ; Client: I was thinking about killing myself. You thought you would help me and you didn't. That's what I want to talk about. I wanna talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me, and you are not available to me when I need help. ; Therapist: Okay. So let's-- Okay, so it sounds like me not being avai-- Was me not being available with you, rela-related to you cutting yourself? ; Client: I cut myself the first time I called you thinking you would help me, you wouldn't help me so then I figured, what the hell I [chuckles] might as well just go all the way. And so, that's why I cut myself that deep.",high
37,"Therapist: Kia ora, Ricky, welcome back. ; Client: Kia ora. ; Therapist: Good. Are you okay today? ; Client: Yeah, yeah fine. ; Therapist: All right. So where we left last time, you were going away to think about a few things and to, um, develop some sort of plan of action. How'd it go? What were you up to? ; Client: Actually, it's been pretty good. I, um, I talked to my mom, which, uh- ; Therapist: Right. ; Client: -which is a big deal. And, uh, she was excellent. Um, I knew she would be. Um, and, uh, I've made an appointment for the, uh, for Stopping Violence and [unintelligible 00:16:15] ; Therapist: Good to know, excellent. ; Client: Um, I've cut down on the drink. I haven't stopped drinking, but, uh-- Yeah, so, uh, it's okay. ; Therapist: Things are looking pretty good. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you've rung your mom, had a chat to her. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Any other whānau members? You talked about your brothers and sisters last time. ; Client: Uh, I didn't speak to my brothers and sisters this time, I just spoke to my mom, but, uh, she, uh, she suggested that I go and stay with my, uh, auntie and my uncle. Uh— ; Therapist: Here in Christchurch? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: I'm not sure. ; Therapist: No? ; Client: I'm not sure, I'm thinking about it. ; Therapist: What are you not sure about? ; Client: Well, I'm not sure if I want to live with my auntie and uncle. [chuckles] Um, I think, yeah, I'll probably need to. I think probably living with, uh, with my mate in his flat is probably not that helpful. ; Therapist: Okay. Just sort of interested, when you rang your mom and, um, told her what's happening, how difficult was it to talk about the issue of violence and being violent towards your partner? ; Client: It was terrible. It was really hard. Uh, I think probably the hardest person to talk to about it, my mom. My, um, my old man, um-- Yeah, it was hard. ; Therapist: We-we talked about, uh, last time that this is hard stuff and that, um, we are prepared to kind of do the hard yard. So you've gone away, you've talked to your folks, put it out there about your issue of violence? Um, I'm thinking about, uh, with-with Tristan and the whole alcohol issue there. So it sounds like to me if you've- you've started to put quite a bit of stuff in place. ; Client: I try. ; Therapist: Yeah. What does it tell me about you as a man, as a father, as someone who wants to get moving? ; Client: Well, I hope it tells you that, um, that I'm a good bloke. That I'm a good dad. That I really- that I'm really serious. I am really serious. ; Therapist: Grand. You talked a little bit about, uh, you'd really like to get back with Kristie? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And-and-and your kids and developing that whānau. Have you had an opportunity to get in touch with her and— ; Client: Uh, yeah, I talked to her about it. We talked a little bit. Um, and she's not completely convinced. ; Therapist: Right. ; Client: Um, but we'll see how it goes. ; Therapist: Okay. So what do you think you're gonna need to do to show her and others, uh, to convince them that you are serious? ; Client: I need to, um, I need to see all these things that I've started to put into action, I need to see them through to the end. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Well. I need to- I need to, uh, to show her that she can trust me. That I'm serious about it. ; Therapist: Yeah.",high
17,"Therapist: Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you a couple of more background questions. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Do you use any tobacco products, or smoke cigarettes? ; Client: No, I would bum cigarettes in college, but I was never a smoker. ; Therapist: Okay. How about in the last year? ; Client: No, not really anything. ; Therapist: Okay. And how often do you have a drink containing alcohol? ; Client: Um, a few times a week. Uh, Wednesdays, I'll go to happy hour and have about two or three. And then, um, Thursdays, seven, um, seven or eight. Fridays, probably just a couple of glasses of wine with dinner. Um, but Saturdays are bigger night. And I would probably have a few drinks before I went to the bar. And then have four or five at when-when I was out. So— ; Therapist: Okay. So it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week, anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day. So, maybe around 20 drinks a week? ; Client: I guess, it sounds like a lot when you say [chuckles] like that. But yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. Do you use any street drugs like any marijuana, cocaine, heroin? ; Client: No. I-I smoked weed in college, but just a little bit. I wasn't a regular smoker. ; Therapist: Do you, um, do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you, or ever use your own prescriptions in a way on which they were not prescribed? ; Client: No. ; Therapist: Okay. So, you know, as we said before, you're drinking-- it sounds like you're drinking about 20 drinks a week, over the course of a few days. And I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week, and no more than three on a given day. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: So you're doing more than that right now. And when you drink more than this amount, it puts you at risk for a number of things, okay? Things like greater risk of injury, damage to different parts of your body, um, just a bunch of different problems. And, uh-- so I'm going to recommend that you cut down- cut down that amount to the recommended limit. Again, that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day. Do you think you could do that? Would that be a good goal for you? ; Client: That's a lot to change. I don't know. ; Therapist: Yeah, I know that making changes isn't always easy. But when you drink more than what's recommended, it creates problems. You know, you said you hurt your ankle when you came out of the bar this time. ; Client: I mean, the stairs were really steep. So— ; Therapist: Yeah. Well, it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol. You know, it can actually affect your balance and stability. So, really, you know, for where you are right now, you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended. And, you know, I want you to be healthy. And I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else. So I'm really gonna recommend that you try to cut down to that amount. So, do you think you could do that, cut down to no more than three drinks on a given day? ; Client: Where are these limits from? Um, old- an older population? Because, uh, I drink just as much as my friends do. I mean, everybody drinks like I drink. I'm not even the biggest drinker in my group. So I'm pretty middle of the road. ; Therapist: So, it sounds like, you know, the amount you drink is pretty normal- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -amongst the people you typically drink with. But these limits are-- they're actually recommended for all adults. And studies have shown that when you drink more than this, it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about. So, you know, why do you think you drink the amount you drink? ; Client: I don't know. It's what we do. It's-- this is how we have fun, I guess. It is fun. ; Therapist: Well, I think you can still have fun within these amounts. So that's what I'm gonna recommend. Um, I think this is a really good goal, and hopefully, we won't see any more injuries. Okay? So why don't you try that? ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: All right. Thank you so much. ; Client: Thanks.",low
9,"Therapist: So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The- ; Client: Sure. ; Therapist: -the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation? ; Client: Not really, I haven't been stressed. Uh, I've been working steady, you know, these days, I'm glad to have a job, I really am happy that I'm working, so. ; Therapist: Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay, do you smoke at all? ; Client: I don't smoke. I smoked, you know, as a young adult, quit 20 years ago. I went cold turkey. I was proud of that, haven't even thought about smoking. ; Therapist: Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine? ; Client: Uh, I do drink beer, I drink, you know, two to three pints on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe four or five. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. ; Client: Well, I-- you know, my pressure has been high for years and, um, you know. ; Therapist: Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there? ; Client: Maybe a little bit. ; Therapist: Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana? ; Client: I don't use heroin or cocaine. I've never even thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school, 20 years or so ago, I smoked reefer, you know. Once I got out of school, I haven't used that at all. ; Therapist: Okay. Have you ever used any prescription medications that weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed? ; Client: No, I don't- I don't, uh, really like the idea of taking pills. Uh, as a matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I had this jaw surgery. They gave me a prescription for Percocet. I took one, maybe feel weird. I think they're still sitting in the medicine cabinet. ; Therapist: Okay, excellent. Well, it sounds to me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health. ; Client: Well, I guess I'll try. ; Therapist: Okay. And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now. We'll recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this, sound okay? ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay.",low
1,"Therapist: And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use? ; Client: Sure. ; Therapist: Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week? ; Client: Yeah, but only on the weekend. ; Therapist: Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks. ; Client: Yeah. Uh, maybe a couple more. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use? ; Client: So, uh, are you saying I drink too much? ; Therapist: How would you define drinking too much? ; Client: Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk. ; Client: So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure? ; Therapist: So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you? ; Client: I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me. ; Therapist: You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people. ; Client: Well, I don't consider my drinking binge drinking. ; Therapist: Why is that? ; Client: I don't chug a lot of beers in a row. I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion. ; Client: But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about? ; Therapist: Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen. ; Client: Well, I didn't know about those things. ; Therapist: Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol? ; Client: Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me. ; Therapist: And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking? ; Client: Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about. ; Therapist: So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term? ; Client: E-exactly. ; Therapist: So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking? ; Client: Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about. ; Therapist: Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking? ; Client: Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then. ; Therapist: So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you. ; Client: Sounds good. ; Therapist: Okay, great. See you next time.",high
52,"Therapist: Hi, Nick. Thank you for completing the CRAFFT questionnaire. I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself. ; Client: You're welcome. ; Therapist: sI see from the questionnaire, did you have got in trouble while using alcohol? Can you tell me more about that? ; Client: Well, a friend and I would snuck out one night to go to the park, and we got a couple of beers from his house, but the cop came by, and so we threw them in the bushes. He was originally gonna give us a curfew ticket but ended up not to. Luckily, he didn't see the beer. ; Therapist: That must be really scary. ; Client: Yeah, it was. If my mom would have found out, she would've killed me. ; Therapist: I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink? ; Client: Well, I've only tried drinking once or twice. ; Therapist: I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right? ; Client: Yeah, that's right. ; Therapist: As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay? ; Client: Well, I'm not sure if this information is for me, since I've only been drinking once or twice. ; Therapist: I understand. You're just experimenting with alcohol. Then, how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are? ; Client: Well, all I really know is that it's not good for you. ; Therapist: Are you surprised what that might be true? ; Client: Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too. ; Therapist: Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information? ; Client: I really didn't think about how this would affect me playing sports. ; Therapist: Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really wanted to play soccer, and you have great goals about that. ; Client: Yeah, I would like to play soccer in college. ; Therapist: That's a great goal to have for yourself. ; Client: Yeah, I would also like to get scholarships. ; Therapist: Scholarship will really help you achieving your goals. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: I would like to share with you these materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about these risks. What do you think about that? ; Client: Well, I will take a look at it, and I'll definitely read it, and I don't wanna become addicted, and I would like to continue to play sports as long as possible. ; Therapist: It sounds like you're in the right track, looks like you care about your health, and you care about your goals in life. I'm here to answer any questions. ; Client: Thanks for all the information. ; Therapist: You're welcome.",high
101,"Therapist: So, Jill, um, I know you're here to talk about your blood pressure today. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Um, before we get into that, I see you filled out our annual screening forms here. So if-if you're okay, can we take a minute to talk about that? ; Client: Sure. ; Therapist: Okay, great. It looks like, um, the way you filled out the alcohol form puts you into our, uh, third zone of drinking. Can you- can you tell me a little bit about your drinking habits, where you drink, what do you like to drink? ; Client: I drink wine- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -mostly. Um, I go down to the little pub down the street. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Have a few glasses of wine. ; Therapist: Okay. Kind of socializing? ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: All right. How often do you do that? ; Client: Hmm, for four times a week probably. ; Therapist: Okay. And on a regular night, how much do you-- how many glasses of wine would you guess you drink? ; Client: Three to four, five. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Maybe if it's on a weekend, maybe six. ; Therapist: Okay. Okay. ; Client: Over a long-- over a period of time. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay. So let me just show you on this, um, card here, um, from a medical perspective, we know that there's good evidence that shows that women you're age who drink more than, um, three drinks on any one occasion at any- at any sitting or more than seven in a week, are likely to run into health problems from their drinking, either problems they're having right now or maybe in the future. ; Client: Are you serious? ; Therapist: Yeah. Surprised, ain't you? ; Client: Seven drinks in a week doesn't seem like that much? ; Therapist: It sounds like you're drinking a bit more than that right now. ; Client: Yeah, and I-I didn't think it was much, but that makes it look like I'm drinking way too much. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. From this, uh, drinker's pyramid over on this side of the card, you can see that the-the score on your screening sheet shows that you're up in the harmful category of drinkers. So that it's likely you're drinking, you know, in quantities probably more than about 90% of the folks who come in to see me here at the clinic. ; Client: Well, I know my drinking has increased a little since I got divorced and moved to Portland, but I-I don't think it's that much of a problem. ; Therapist: It doesn't feel like a problem to you right now, yeah. ; Client: No, not really. ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. And then the other thing I should mention, Jill, um, drinking more than these quantities, it's-it's possible it could be pushing your blood pressure up a bit, and I'm wondering if that might be affecting the difficulty we're having getting your blood pressure down right now. ; Client: I didn't realize that drinking had anything to do with blood pressure. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, it can sometimes. ; Client: Oh, well. Well, then I guess that could be a problem. ; Therapist: My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking. What-what do you think about that? ; Client: I guess I can cut down some. ; Therapist: Okay. So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale? ; Client: I'd probably a 6. ; Therapist: Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there? ; Client: Well, I didn't realize that drinking was related to my blood pressure problems. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: And I did fall earlier this year on my home from the bar and hurt my shoulder. I don't think the drinking made me fall, but it probably didn't help the situation. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: And though my son keeps telling me that I'm drinking too much, and it's scary to think that my drinking is harmful. It's a big word. ; Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit. ; Client: Sounds like it to me. ; Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar. ; Client: I think I can try to do that, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking? ; Client: I guess I could use those numbers, and I can't make any promises, but I could try to drink less than three in a night and less than seven in a week. ; Therapist: Okay. Okay. ; Client: That mean I can only drink two or three times a week. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying? ; Client: Like I can try that, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. Okay. ; Client: I don't think I need to quit, but I think I can try to cut down. ; Therapist: And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week? ; Client: That's what I'll shoot for. ; Therapist: Okay. I think that sounds like a great step for you as your doctor. Why don't we revisit this the next time you come in to talk about your blood pressure in about six weeks or so and, um, then we can see how you're doing with it. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: All right? ; Client: Sounds good. ; Therapist: Well, let's get back to your blood pressure then and see what we need to do about that. ; Client: Okay.",high
0,"Therapist: Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down? ; Client: Sure. ; Therapist: So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -and you usually have three to four drinks when you do drink. ; Client: Usually three drinks and glasses of wine. ; Therapist: Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week. ; Client: Something like that. ; Therapist: Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking. ; Client: Well, I usually drink when I'm at home trying to unwind and I drink while I'm watching a movie. And sometimes, um, I take a bath but I also drink when I take a bath sometimes. ; Therapist: Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use? ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women. ; Client: Hmm. Seven? ; Therapist: Seven. ; Client: Wow. I knew my doctor didn't like me drinking the amount that I did but I didn't know that seven was the limit. ; Therapist: Yeah, you're surprised to hear that? ; Client: Yes. What-what kind of health problems? ; Therapist: Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat. ; Client: Hmm. Well, that's not good news. ; Therapist: Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced? ; Client: Well, to be honest, I drink sometimes when I'm feeling down and I find it more interesting and not so blur. ; Therapist: Okay. And how do you feel after you drink? ; Client: Well, then I feel blur again. ; Therapist: So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to. ; Client: Yes on occasion. ; Therapist: And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink. ; Client: Sometimes I just don't like how much I drink. I sometimes finish a bottle in one night. ; Therapist: So you're not proud of finishing a bottle? ; Client: No, it's not like I get crazy or anything but I just don't like the amount that I'm drinking. ; Therapist: Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink. ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking. ; Therapist: Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits? ; Client: Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week. That seems like a lot but I would consider cutting back to two drinks a night. I think that would be my goal. ; Therapist: If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at? ; Client: I'd say an eight. ; Therapist: Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six? ; Client: Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse. ; Therapist: What would help you cut back to two drinks? ; Client: Maybe having less wine in the house. ; Therapist: Having less wine in the house will help? ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings? ; Client: Well, I like to watch movies, read a book, and take a bath but sometimes I drink when I take a bath. ; Therapist: So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too. ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yes. ; Therapist: Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back. ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it? ; Client: Sure. ; Therapist: Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds. ; Client: Okay.",high
89,"Therapist: Tell me a little bit about what brings you today. ; Client: Well, my wife is making me be here today.

Um, so do you not feel like it's a problem for you? ; Client: No, I don't think it's a problem at all. It's something I do to help me relax. In fact, I think it's something that is good for me, but— ; Therapist: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about how, like, it's-it's not an issue for you? ; Client: Yeah. You know, like I said, you know, I'll come home, I'll, you know, smoke a couple rolls after a long day or something. I'm able to just relax, not really think about things. You know what I mean? I'm still working and, you know, paying the bills. We have a house, so I don't- I don't know why it's a problem. ; Therapist: Okay. Um, is it causing any problems in areas like your marriage or anything like that? ; Client: I mean, I guess a little bit, you know, like-- I mean, she's the one that-that has me being here. We've been fighting about it, you know. Uh, uh, I don't know, I-I guess I'm-I'm getting pretty frustrated with her. She just won't get off my back about it. So I finally said, ""Fine, I'll go see someone."" ; Therapist: Okay. Um, so are you here to maybe work on your marriage? Is that an area that you are wanting to-to work on? ; Client: Uh, I mean, I'm just here because she said that I need to be in here. So, I mean, yeah, I wanna save my marriage, you know. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And, I mean, I love her, you know, but I'm here because she's making me be here. ; Therapist: Okay. Um, what is it that you wanna get out of being here? ; Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high. ; Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have? ; Client: Well, I mean, I just failed the UA at work. Uh, I think I failed UA at work. I don't know. I-I use- I use some stuff that was [inaudible 00:02:00] not my system. But- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I don't- I don't think it's gonna work. And so I really liked to be able to keep my job. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Um, I'd l- I'd like to stop fighting with my wife. Um- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -I guess those are my big goals. ; Therapist: Okay. Um, do you see your substance use as being, um, maybe a cause of those other issues at all? Do you see them linked at all? ; Client: I mean, yeah, I guess- I guess if I think about it, that's kind of the common theme. ; Therapist: Okay. Okay, um, how do you think that your substance use is going to affect your employment? ; Client: I'm pretty worried that I'm gonna get fired. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: I don't- I don't really know. We're the only shop in town that-that does the work that we use. So I don't- I don't know what else I'm gonna go do. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: So— ; Therapist: Okay. Um, and if you lost your job, what do you see being the consequences of that? ; Client: Um, my wife might leave me. Uh, might lose the house. Um, can't pay my bills. ; Therapist: Okay. Do you see that at all as being affected by the substance use? ; Client: Yeah, it's probably- it's probably the reason why all that's happening. I mean- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -If I lose my job, it's 'cause I failed the UA, so— ; Therapist: Okay. Um, so can you talk to me a little bit about, um, maybe where you wanna be 90 days from now? What do you want your life to look like? ; Client: I'll still have a job. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Still have a wife and, uh, yeah, if I-- If those two things can happen then, you know— ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I mean, I know if-if I lose my job, she leaving me. She's been getting after me about smoking weed for a long time, so— ; Therapist: Okay. So that's where you wanna get to.

55,"Therapist: Miguel, before we end the call, I did want to go over the answers you gave me on the questionnaire about drug use. Is it okay if we go over that right now? ; Client: Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. ; Therapist: Thanks. When I looked at your form, it looks like you use heroin weekly and you injected. What part of your body do you normally inject in? ; Client: Uh, mostly in my left arm. ; Therapist: Do you mind if I take a look at your arm, please? ; Client: Uh, no. That's okay. How's that? ; Therapist: Okay. Well, I don't see any redness. Um, can you go ahead and touch that Miguel, and tell me if it feels warm to you or if it hurts? ; Client: Uh, nope. It feels okay. ; Therapist: Thanks. Just so you know, when I talk to patients about drug use, my job is to be helpful. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what you should do. What I can do is share some information and be a resource. Does that make sense? ; Client: Uh, yeah, that's fine. ; Therapist: Right. What else can you tell me about your heroin use? ; Client: Uh, I don't know. Um, I use maybe a few times a week. ; Therapist: A couple of times a week. And where do you get your syringes? ; Client: Syringes? Uh, sometimes I'll buy them at Walgreens. Most times I'll just get them from the needle exchange. ; Therapist: Uh, what one do you remember? ; Client: Uh, Northeast Glisan. ; Therapist: Okay. How often do you use new deals when you inject? ; Client: Yeah, I use new needles every time, I never share. ; Therapist: Yeah, it sounds like your health is important to you. ; Client: Yeah, that's right. ; Therapist: And you showed up today to take care of your migraines. ; Client: Mm-hmm, yap. ; Therapist: So, uh, you wrote on here that you've experienced withdrawal symptoms when you've stopped using in the past, is that right? ; Client: Uh, yeah. Yeah, if it's, uh, you know, if it's been a couple of days like I can go two days, three days tops before I start to feel really sick. ; Therapist: What does that feel like? ; Client: Uh, geez. Yeah, I mean, it's the obvious stuff like my stomach feels sick, I get the body aches, uh, cold, hot, chills. Uh, everything hurts. Everything is in extremes. My emotions are in extremes. Uh, yeah, it sucks. I don't want to do anything. I just want to stay home and just stay in bed. ; Therapist: That sounds awful. What do you do when that happens? ; Client: Yeah, I mean, I start to use, I get loaded. ; Therapist: Okay. How else does injecting heroin impact your life? ; Client: Uh, you know, I get loaded and I-I can- I can function. I can go to work and, you know, do normal things, you know. Uh, I mean, there's been maybe just a couple of times where I wasn't feeling all that well, and I, uh, I was late a couple of times to work or it might overslept from the night before or whatever, but it's about it. Uh, I just want to avoid getting sick right now. That's my main priority. ; Therapist: Yeah. You want to stay healthy. I'm curious, what do you like about using heroin? ; Client: Um, well, you know, I like the way it feels. Um, you know what I mean? When I shoot up my anxiety, goes away, my depression goes away. Uh, things that usually make life really difficult, uh, get a lot easier. ; Therapist: And what about your use do you not like? ; Client: Uh, yeah. I mean, I think everybody who uses at least has some concern of overdosing on some level. Right? Uh, so that's something I'm concerned about is accidentally overdosing. And, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't want to get an infection in my arm, you know, just the usual things. I have a hard time hitting veins sometimes, and I gotta dig around a little bit and I would get worried about, you know, hitting something that I shouldn't or, you know, getting infections. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So on one hand, using heroin feels like an escape from things you don't want to think about. On the other hand, it puts you at risk for an overdose in infections. ; Client: Yeah, that's right. ; Therapist: So weighing what you like and don't like about your use, where do you want to go from here? What do you want to do differently? ; Client: I don't know. ; Therapist: Well, some patients who inject heroin are interested in a medication called Suboxone. It reduces cravings, withdrawal symptoms without making you high. Some patients want information on how to inject drugs more safely or where to get new syringes. Other patients want to carry Naloxone which is a drug that can prevent one from overdosing. ; Client: Uh, are you talking about Narcan? Is that the same thing? ; Therapist: Yes. ; Client: Yeah, I got some of that already. I got it from the needle exchange. ; Therapist: Where do you keep it? ; Client: Uh, at home mostly. ; Therapist: In case you see someone overdosing? ; Client: I mean, that's a concern, of course, right? Uh, I'm on the app just in case somebody nearby is OD-ing and I can get pinged. But no, mostly I just keep it in case I overdose, uh, and, uh, I'm realizing now I have it but I haven't told my roommate about it so— ; Therapist: Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing. ; Client: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. ; Therapist: Anything else you want to do about your use? ; Client: I would really like a little bit of information on, uh, injecting in my arm. ; Therapist: Okay. I can email you some information on how to inject in a way that reduces the chance of infection and we also have behavioral health specialists in our clinic who can go over how to reduce harm with you. I bet the syringe exchange has similar resources too. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: So it sounds like you have two goals right now. You want to tell your housemate about where you keep the Narcan in case you overdose and you want some information on how to inject safely? ; Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah. ; Therapist: How confident are you to do these two things? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 meaning not ready at all and 10 meaning very ready, what number would you pick? ; Client: I'd probably say 10. ; Therapist: Okay. You're very ready. Why do you think you picked a 10 instead of a lower number like 8? ; Client: Well, uh, I don't want to have an overdose and I don't want to get an infection. Seems like easy things to do. ; Therapist: What kind of plan could you put in place to make sure you meet these goals? ; Client: Um, well, I can talk to my housemate tomorrow night. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't work tomorrow night so he'll be around. ; Therapist: That's great. And how do you want to get the information on injecting? ; Client: Uh, if you could email me that right now, that'd be great. ; Therapist: Okay. I'd like to hear how your plan worked out for you if you're willing to come back for another appointment. I look forward to hearing about what worked for you and what was challenging say in four weeks. ; Client: Uh, yeah, yeah. It's fine. Let's do that. ; Therapist: Great. I'll see you then.",high
18,"Therapist: So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So? ; Client: I don't really know what issues I need to sort. ; Therapist: Sorry? ; Client: I don't really know what issues I need to- ; Therapist: All right. ; Client: -sort. It's just a bit of cash. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: So— ; Therapist: So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? ; Client: Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Client: It's not an issue. ; Therapist: Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? ; Client: Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Client: And some nights you do, so. ; Therapist: Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket ; Client: Well, I don't really keep track. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? ; Client: I don't know. A few times a week. ; Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. ; Client: I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. ; Therapist: That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? ; Client: I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. ; Therapist: Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] ; Client: It's the unlucky ones. ; Therapist: Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um— ; Client: A bit of a rush, I suppose. ; Therapist: A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. ; Client: Yeah, I suppose. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. ; Client: I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? ; Client: Much the same, bunch of party girls. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? ; Client: Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. ; Therapist: Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? ; Client: Sarah. ; Therapist: Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? ; Client: I don't know. ; Therapist: What would she say about— ; Client: We'd just have a laugh. ; Therapist: Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? ; Client: Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. ; Therapist: Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? ; Client: At times. ; Therapist: At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? ; Client: I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. ; Therapist: Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some— ; Client: Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -I don't know. ; Therapist: Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that? ; Client: I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing. ; Therapist: Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch? ; Client: I don't know, you tell me. ; Therapist: How about then your-your kind of hunch about that? ; Client: Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -you know, it did, so I'm here- ; Therapist: Yeah- ; Client: -so, I suppose— ; Therapist: -so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day? What are we talking here? ; Client: It's a couple of grand or something. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah. ; Client: Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for. [chuckles] I worked [unintelligible 00:10:35] and I was getting paid $18 an hour- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -$25, you do the math. [chuckles] And that's gonna support me? ; Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together. So, I'm wondering, how open are you to, you know, seeing this situation from lots of different angles? ; Client: I don't know. I'm usually an open person. [chuckles] ; Therapist: Yeah? Yeah. ; Client: Just provided it will help me deal with it. ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about? ; Client: I don't know. I am just usually pretty open with people. It's a bit different here tonight and- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -just not knowing what to expect then— ; Therapist: Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far? ; Client: I don't know. I suppose I'm saying that the money did add up, and that was enough for me to end up here, so- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -I suppose I'm here for a reason. [chuckles] ; Therapist: Yeah. You know, like-- I-- And, some people wouldn't even, sort of, get in the door or wouldn't be as open as you've been today, okay, to an extent, so, you know, like I said, good on you, yeah. You know, being able to-- It's hard to come to a place like this and start to really open up, so, you know, you've just shown that you can do that. Yeah. ; Client: I didn't have a choice. [chuckles] ; Therapist: Well, you have a choice about what you open up to me about. Absolutely, you have a choice about that, yeah. That coming, being on sentence, no, you don't have a choice about that, um, well, you have a choice, 'cause, I mean, you can choose not to come, and you'll be breached and get to head back to court. ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: Um, but you do have a choice about how you are here when we meet, and what-what we talk about here. So, um, you know, so you do have lots of choices within that. And, my sense is you're, sort of, you know, a young woman who will make some good choices about that 'cause you're not a bad person, and you know that. ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: Yeah.",high
84,"Therapist: Hi Billy. How are you doing? ; Client: Yeah, I'm all right. ; Therapist: Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you here and good to see you here on time. Yeah, it's really good to see a good start to the-- to your probation time with us here is to see you being here on time. So how did you get here today? ; Client: Just caught the bus. ; Therapist: Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here? ; Client: Just a waste of my time. ; Therapist: Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here."" ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on? ; Client: Last time didn't really work out that well. ; Therapist: Yeah, didn't- didn't work out very well. ; Client: Nothing really helped me. ; Therapist: Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too. ; Client: Yeah, I'd say so. ; Therapist: Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time? ; Client: She didn't really listen to me, just told me what to do. She just bossed me around. ; Therapist: Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here? ; Client: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you. ; Client: Yeah, she didn't really care. ; Therapist: Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think? ; Client: I-I don't care that you're a woman. It's just- it's that you don't know what it's like to be me. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: You have a different upbringing and live in a different place of town. Just- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -you wouldn't understand. ; Therapist: Okay, and all of those things are true. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you. ; Client: Yeah, so it is. ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all."" ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: 100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale? ; Client: Well, not too high. It's not like I'm out killing people or anything. It's just- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -silly stuff. ; Therapist: All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff? ; Client: Mm, lots. When I stop getting caught. Don't wanna be back here again. ; Therapist: Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and- ; Client: No. ; Therapist: -to talk to a probation officer again. ; Client: No, sorry. ; Therapist: Okay. So where would you be do you think? ; Client: Mm, like what out of a scale it would like fall? ; Therapist: Zero being, ""Argh, not interested at all,"" 100 being totally into it. ; Client: Mmh, 25. ; Therapist: 25, okay. ; Client: Mmh. ; Therapist: So I know that you're kind of 25% interested- ; Client: Mmh. ; Therapist: -and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble. ; Client: Maybe but, mm, yeah, I wanna stop getting into trouble. ; Therapist: You wanna stop getting into trouble. ; Client: Yeah, but I don't think what I'm doing is that bad. ; Therapist: Mm, okay. ; Client: Just unlucky. ; Therapist: Okay, so getting into trouble and, uh, getting caught and-and we see [unintelligible 00:05:36] does about luck and this time being unlucky. ; Client: Yeah, the cops just have it out for me. ; Therapist: Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the [unintelligible 00:05:46] the cops have got it on for you? ; Client: Just 'cause growing up dealing with them and my mates and stuff and there's, you know, guilty before charged or whatever. ; Therapist: Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky. ; Client: Yeah, me and my mates always get singled out. ; Therapist: Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. So I'm wondering, um, if there are things that you think, ""Well, I can see that that's got me into trouble,"" and, you know, kind of cops aside, things that might have got you into-into trouble. ; Client: Just jacking cars and just stealing just, like, stuff and smokes and got done for that. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm, okay. So some stuff that you can think, ""Oh yeah, I had, you know, I did some stuff that yeah, got me into trouble."" ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: It wasn't perhaps about the police singling you out. So those little things, well, you think, ""Mm, yeah, maybe-maybe if I'd done something differently, I wouldn't have ended up in trouble."" How interested are you in thinking about those things and- ; Client: Yeah, well, I- ; Therapist: -trying to get a handle on that. ; Client: -wanna stop getting in trouble. Don't wanna- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -end up in prison for the rest of my life for doing stupid little things. ; Therapist: Okay, so you don't wanna end up kind of being in prison again 'cause you've done some time inside. Yeah, and you don't wanna end up going back to prison, yeah. So-so that's one thing about wanting to make a difference and the way things are at the moment, yeah. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Cool. What else would, um, would help to kind of keep you out of trouble do you think? ; Client: Get some income, some good cash or something. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: A nice job. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: A good-- yeah. ; Therapist: So the things about that have got you into trouble in the past, um, how confident are you that, um, that you can do something to not keep going down the same path? Zero is like, ""I'm not confident at all that I can make any changes,"" and 100 is like, ""I'm so supremely confident."" Where would you be? ; Client: Pretty confident if I had a good job but otherwise, probably have to keep stealing stuff, I don't know. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: So it depends. ; Therapist: All right, so if you were in a good job- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -one with cars, one that- ; Client: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: -you really liked, you feel that you would be pretty confident to deal with the stuff that gets you into trouble? ; Client: Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause it's just small stuff that, you know, just 'cause I don't have any cash. ; Therapist: Okay, so you don't have any cash and that's the stuff that causes you to do the small stuff- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -and get you into trouble. ; Client: Yeah, just stupid little shit, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, so if you had a job, you feel pretty confident, but if you don't have a job, your confidence is much-is much lower, is that- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -what I'm hearing? Yeah. ; Client: Yeah, no. That's- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -not an excuse but, yeah, I'll probably keep doing it. Just try not to get caught. ; Therapist: Okay, so if you don't have a job you reckon, um, you'll probably gonna keep on offending. ; Client: Yeah. Yeah, I just get bored and stuff. ; Therapist: Okay, so part of this, what's going on is you also getting bored? ; Client: Yeah, I get bored real easy. ; Therapist: Mmh. Yeah, say something more about that. It sounds really interesting about you knowing that you get bored really easily. ; Client: I don't know. I got a short attention span or something. ; Therapist: Yeah, what-what makes you say that? ; Client: Uh, just can't sit around home all day. I'd wanna go out and do something exciting. ; Therapist: Okay, so you wanna kind of get some action, don't wanna sit around- ; Client: Mmh. ; Therapist: -all the time. But one of the things I'm noticing, we've been going here for a wee while now talking and, uh, I haven't noticed any lack of attention. ; Client: Just talking about something I like. Like talking about cars is all good. ; Therapist: Okay, so we [unintelligible 00:09:47] something that interests you. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Mmh, and when we might be talking about something that doesn't interest you, what would I notice? ; Client: I probably just wouldn't listen. ; Therapist: Okay. All right, so-so one of the challenges is for us to be talking about things that interest you. Yeah. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Um, and also maybe get to the point where things are different in your life Where you're not getting into trouble and things feel a bit more sorted in your life. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Hi, Billy, how are you doing? It's good to see you again. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, how's things been? ; Client: Well, not too bad. Yeah, getting out of trouble. ; Therapist: Okay. So you're keeping out of trouble. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, so how'd you get here this time? Like 'cause other times you got the bus? What-what did you do this time? ; Client: Ah, I got a lift from Donna. She's- ; Therapist: Oh yeah. Who's- who's Donna? You haven't mentioned Donna before. ; Client: Like she's my new girlfriend. ; Therapist: Oh okay. Tell us something about Donna. ; Client: Ah, just met her a few weeks ago and she's just, uh, real cool. She's really nice. Yeah, get along with her really well. ; Therapist: Hmm, you get along with her really well. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So what's special about Donna? ; Client: Donna is easy to talk to unlike other girls that I don't really get along with. Uh, she's like and a good friend too so- ; Therapist: Oh okay. So someone who's both a friend and a girlfriend? ; Client: Yeah. I can hang out with her and stuff and she gets all my mates and stuff. So it's all good. ; Therapist: Hmm, yeah. It's really special when you find someone who can be both a friend and girlfriend, eh. ; Client: Yeah, and I'm lucky. ; Therapist: Yeah. You were made to say you're lucky. ; Client: She's just a really nice girl. ; Therapist: Hmm. Okay, so she dropped you off here today. ; Client: Yeah, it's good of her. ; Therapist: So what does she think about you coming here? ; Client: She thinks it's good. Yeah. Uh, she doesn't want to get in trouble and stuff. ; Therapist: She doesn't want to get you in trouble and I heard you say earlier on that you've been keeping out of trouble. ; Client: Yeah, I was just getting busy with her and stuff. So it's all good. ; Therapist: So what sort of things have you been doing together? ; Client: Just, uh, just hanging out. Just watching movies and stuff just, I don't know, gives me something to do. ; Therapist: Okay. Gives you something to do. So we talked like back on that first time we met about how you reckon you've got a short attention span and like things to like to be doing things. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you're watching movies with her, you're hanging out? ; Client: It's, yeah, just chilling with her. It's good. ; Therapist: Yeah, and keeping-keeping out of trouble. ; Client: Yeah mostly, yeah. ; Therapist: Okay, what's the mostly? ; Client: Uh, you know, [chuckles] mostly. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So when you say mostly, it kind of leaves a little bit of room for there to be some trouble. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Am I picking that up? ; Client: Oh no, just stupid stuff. Just when she like-- she has to go to work and stuff, so I have to keep myself busy. ; Therapist: Okay, so she's- she's got a job. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah, what does she do? ; Client: She just works the whole day just typing numbers and stuff. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So kind of 9:00 to 5:00 sort of job. ; Client: Yeah. She actually goes there four days a week though. ; Therapist: All right. ; Client: So we get to chill on Friday. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So you two get to spend Friday together and the weekend. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay, so when she's at work, what happens then? ; Client: Well, uh, sleeping and then, I don't know, catch up my mates if they're not doing anything and just get up to mischief with them. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So what sort of mischief are we talking about here, Billy? ; Client: It's, uh, [unintelligible 00:13:34] for the cars out there, [unintelligible 00:13:36] no not-not normally. Yeah. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay, so you're kind of skating on the edges of getting in trouble again. ; Client: Yeah, I'm being careful though so- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay. So I'm wondering how much of what you do on Fridays you tell Donna. ; Client: But what do you mean? ; Therapist: Well, if we're talking about this idea about kind of scaling around the edges of trouble again,- ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: - I'm wondering if she knows that. ; Client: No, not really. ; Therapist: So what do you reckon would happen if she knew? ; Client: She'd tell me off. ; Therapist: She'd tell you off. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Well, what-what are her hopes for you, Billy? ; Client: Uh, okay, she wants me to be happy, I don't know. Me to get a job or something. So, get a nice car we could cruise around in it. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah. So she wants you to be happy. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So what would- what would like a really happy life for Billy look like? ; Client: Just be able to buy her stuff. Nice car, nice house. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. A nice car, a nice house. Mm-hmm, what else? What must be a happy life for Billy? ; Client: Just and it'd be good just me, her and just be able to provide for her would be cool. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm, okay. So in five years' time, it's fast forward to the future. Five years time, how would you like it to be? ; Client: Just settle down and maybe have some kids or something, family life. ; Therapist: Okay. So, you'd be with Donna, and you'd have a house, and you settle down, maybe have some kids? ; Client: Yeah. It'd be cool. ; Therapist: Yes? So, it sounds like having children is something you've thought about? Um. ; Client: Yeah, I know she'd be a good mum, yeah. So— ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. She'd be a good mum? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? What sort of dad do you reckon you'd be? ; Client: I'd be all right. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: What would be special about you as a dad? ; Client: Uh, I wouldn't boss them around. ; Therapist: You wouldn't boss them around? ; Client: No. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. That's something- that's something that's come up before with-with-- when we've been talking about that idea about not liking being bossed around. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: What's that about, Billy? ; Client: I don't know. It's just like-- My dad was really strict on me when I was little, and I don't want to be like that. ; Therapist: Okay, I see. You wanna be a different sort of dad- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -to-to the dad that you had? ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: Yeah. Okay.",high
5,"Therapist: Hi, Billy. ; Client: Hi. ; Therapist: Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that? ; Client: Yeah, no, it's easy. ; Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting? ; Client: Uh. Meeting's definitely helped. ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Client: Yeah. It's helped- ; Therapist: Yeah? ; Client: -heaps. ; Therapist: It's helped heaps? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with? ; Client: Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy? ; Client: Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that? ; Client: Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you? ; Client: I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier. ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time. ; Client: Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: [clears throat] ; Therapist: Okay. So, what did you say to Donna? ; Client: [clears throat] Oh, I just said-- I said, ""Uh, could you give me a hand with this?"" ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And, like, she filled them up for me, and I told her what to write. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that [unintelligible 00:27:23] for you? ; Client: Just-- I-I asked her to fill that out for me because I said I'd be too messy. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life? ; Client: Like, a big difference, but, like, it's not like I don't try. ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: Like, I'm just not really good with it. ; Therapist: Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing. ; Client: Yeah. Like [unintelligible 00:28:13] if I'd got into polytech and stuff, so I think that's good. ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, where are the forms now? ; Client: They're still at home. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Yeah. If— ; Therapist: So, what needs to happen next? ; Client: Just take them in. ; Therapist: So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you? ; Client: Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that? ; Client: Uh, probably by the end of this week. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there? ; Client: I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that? ; Client: Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something. ; Therapist: Mm. Yeah? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now? ; Client: Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way. ; Therapist: So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending? ; Client: Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy. ; Therapist: Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or? ; Client: Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight. ; Therapist: It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And that's helping keep you in check, as you said? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or? ; Client: I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates. ; Therapist: Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength? ; Client: Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do. ; Therapist: Mm. What do you think? ; Client: Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh. ; Therapist: Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and- ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea. ; Client: No. ; Therapist: So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah? ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future. ; Client: Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment. ; Therapist: Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking? ; Client: Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking. ; Therapist: Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next- ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: -kind of minute or so- ; Client: No. Just, like, it's not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah. ; Therapist: So it's not your idea. And you also go along with it? ; Client: Yeah. You can't really be like, ""Oh no,"" just give me shit. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no? ; Client: Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don't know. And they'd talk me into it probably. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -'cause of what they- what they thought of you. ; Client: They'd just think I was joking, yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys. ; Client: I don't see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I don't think, like, I am not sure they like it. ; Therapist: Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past? ; Client: They don't lead me into trouble. But- ; Therapist: Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it. ; Client: Uh, like it's my choice though, they don't make me. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Yeah. I know it's just having grown up with, it's just what we've always done. ; Therapist: Okay. So that's just what you've always done. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are? ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be? ; Client: My life? Well, what do you mean? ; Therapist: Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different? ; Client: I don't know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff. ; Therapist: Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too? ; Client: Yeah, 'cause then we could hang out together and stuff- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -with our girlfriends and stuff. ; Therapist: So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -now that you're with Donna? ; Client: Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but- ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Client: -just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff. ; Therapist: Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate? ; Client: It's, like, loyal- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -yes, someone who's got my back. ; Therapist: So, someone who's loyal, someone who's got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate? ; Client: That's about it. It's-- yeah. ; Therapist: Hmm. ; Client: Someone who'll stand up for you. ; Therapist: Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation? ; Client: I mean, support me. ; Therapist: Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy? ; Client: Just don't give me shit about, I don't know. Um, yeah, just, if I- if I don't wanna go do something, don't, like, don't give me shit about it. ; Therapist: Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -like these guys have been around for you- ; Client: Yeah, yeah, they [unintelligible 00:36:38] ; Therapist: -for quite some time, and they're really important to you. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, ""No, I don't wanna do that,"" and they're supportive of you? ; Client: Mm. ; Therapist: What do you think it would take? ; Client: Just they know that I'm serious. ; Therapist: Okay. So, how would they know you're serious? ; Client: I guess, like, if they actually know I'm going to polytech and stuff that they might understand. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: But, like I feel guilty if they wanna go and have fun, and I'm not with them. ; Therapist: Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that. ; Client: Yeah. Like, just going out with them or spending some times with them-- time with them, but, like, I really wanna spend time with Donna too- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -so, it'd be cool if we could spend time together, like, with Donna and my mates. ; Therapist: Okay. So, it's almost as if you feel a bit torn because you wanna be with Donna, but you also wanna be with your- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -with your mates? ; Client: Yeah, like-- Well, I know I get into trouble with them, but they're still my mates, and I- ; Therapist: Mm. ; Client: -feel-- ; Therapist: Yeah, so they're still important to you? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Hmm. I also am hearing that you don't wanna get into trouble anymore. ; Client: No. ; Therapist: Mm. Yeah.",high
15,"Therapist: Can I help you? ; Client: Uh, yeah. I just got off work, and apparently, they're going smoke-free, so I'm-- I-I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and the-- they say they don't work really well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day. ; Therapist: So you want nicotine replacement, but you don't wanna quit smoking? ; Client: Maybe like da-- during the day nicotine replacement. Is that-- I mean, do you have anything like that? ; Therapist: We don't really recommend that. The idea is you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit, so then you wouldn't be smoking at work, but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either. ; Client: Well, I don't really wanna quit. I mean, I like smoking. I like go-- after work, I have a beer with my friends, and I'll smoke cigarettes. I mean, it's not really a big deal. Cigarettes aren't that bad. I mean, I know that the-- it's popular to say that smoking is bad for you but, you know, I like it, so I'm gonna be doing it. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, smoking really is really bad for you, you know. It causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease- ; Client: Yeah, yeah. Okay. ; Therapist: -oral diseases. ; Client: Okay. Well, what are my options? You know, assuming that I'm right, what are my options? ; Therapist: Well, to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch. I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking. That can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all, I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now. ; Client: Well, I mean, I s-- I-I-I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean, I've probably smoked for about five or six years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes, but it's sort of hard to get through the day at work. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, we actually consider 20 cigarettes a day to be a significant amount, and in fact, I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement. ; Client: Sounds good to me. The more nicotine, the better. Is it like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. I mean, do you have— ; Therapist: Well, there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, and probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day, however, but gum is something you use just when you have a craving. ; Client: Oh. Okay. Well, where is that? ; Therapist: Well, we have that here, but again, the-the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking. ; Client: Well, I-- [sighs] I'm probably not gonna buy anything today. I mean, I just came by to see what my options are. I-- if-- thanks for the input. I mean, do you have anything else, do you have any other advice for me? ; Therapist: Well, aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge, that would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement, but again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke. ; Client: Oh, well. Okay. Well, thanks. I mean, I guess that helps a little bit. I'll-- maybe I'll be back later. Thanks. ; Therapist: Okay.",low
130,"Client: Wow. I can't believe he fell asleep after all of that crying, poor guy. ; Therapist: Yeah. Well, the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia. It's just an upper re-respiratory tract infection and a cold. So there's some things you can do to make- to help him get better. You can avoid excessive dust. You can keep him hydrated, avoid over-the-counter cold remedies. Keep him away from people who have flu or cold-like symptoms and avoid smoke. And the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy. ; Client: Well, you're right. I-I did quit smoking when I was pregnant, but actually, um, a couple of weeks ago, I went out, my mom was able to take Jake for the night and my friends they were having a birthday party and we had a couple of glasses of wine and it felt like old times. So before I knew it, I was out having a cigarette with them. And since then I've been having a couple of cigarettes a day, you know, just at the end of the day after I put Jake to bed. But that sounds like it has nothing to do with what you're talking about, right? ; Therapist: No, wait a minute. That has everything to do with what we're talking about. I can't believe at the end of this appointment, you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again. That's very, very important information for me to know. And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now. ; Client: Well, I had no idea that it was such a big deal. I-I didn't think it would have anything to do with Jake getting sick or, you know, hurting him. ; Therapist: Come on, Hailey. You're here because you thought he had pneumonia. You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? Do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your-your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risks that you're posing to yourself and your own health? ; Client: Well, you know, I-I was doing perfectly well. It was just when I went out with my friends and, you know, usually, I'm fine with the cravings. It's just when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. And if I have more than two or three, I just get that craving for a cigarette. And if I have cigarettes in the house, it just happens. You know, I'm doing pretty good. ; Therapist: So it sounds like if you have alcohol, then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do. You need to go home and as your-your son's doctor, I need to tell you you need to go home and throw out those cigarettes. You need to quit. ; Client: Okay. Um, well, yeah, I-I guess I can throw the cigarettes. And tomorrow night when I have my glass of wine, I'll-I'll just try to avoid that craving. ; Therapist: And let's talk some more about wine. You keep throwing wine into the conversation. It sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine. How much are you drinking? ; Client: Only a couple of drinks a night. You know, it's pretty rare if I have anything more than that. It's just my way of relaxing at the end of the day. It's been so stressful since Jake came along. It's just how I fall asleep at the end of the night. ; Therapist: Well, no one said motherhood was going to be easy, Hailey. So let's talk about these drinks. Are we talking about the-the low-risk drinking guidelines, one to two standard drinks a night or are we talking about a mug of Margarita's? ; Client: Well. ; Therapist: What are you drinking? What's the quantity that you're drinking. ; Client: I guess about- I have about a half a glass a night and maybe two. Very rarely I'll have more than that. You know, it just helps me kind of relax. ; Therapist: There's other ways to relax. There's yoga. There's deep breathing. You need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid. This is not okay. You're not just worrying about Hailey anymore. It's Hailey and Jake. You're a mom now. ; Client: I didn't know it was such a big deal. I-I never thought that there would be any impacts on Jake because of it. ; Therapist: I'm trying not to be hard on you, Hailey, but I've got to tell you as a position, it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home. You're throwing out your cigarettes. You're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol? ; Client: I guess I'll do the same thing. I'll go home and throw out the bottles of wine and stop having a glass at the end of the day. ; Therapist: Sounds good. And if you need to relax, go for a walk, join a moms group, read a book. How about you come back in a week when we have Jake's six months checkup and you can let me know how that quit plan is going. ; Client: Okay, I'll try my best. ; Therapist: Thanks.",low
128,"Client: Wow, I can't believe he stopped crying finally and fell asleep. Poor guy. ; Therapist: Yeah. He wasn't too happy with the exam, was he Hailey? ; Client: No he wasn't. ; Therapist: Um, well the good news is that the exam's over and I don't think Jake has pneumonia. What I actually think he has is a cold. So there are some things you could do to manage his symptoms. Would you be interested in knowing? ; Client: Yeah, absolutely. ; Therapist: What I would recommend is that you avoid over-the-counter cold remedies, keep him away from any friends or family who may have the flu, keep him well hydrated, um, avoid excessive dust, and avoid smoking. And at least that last one's easy because you are an ex-smoker now. ; Client: Well, you're right actually, I-I did quit smoking but just last week my mom took Jake for the first time. It was a Friday night, so friends were going out to celebrate a birthday. ; Therapist: Oh, fun. ; Client: Yeah. At one point in the night, though, they all went out to have a cigarette and I joined them. Since then, I've been having a couple of cigarettes at night, but never near Jake and never near his clothes or his toys. I mean, I've heard about second-hand smoking. And I-I don't want to be- expose him to it, so I've been avoiding him when I smoke. ; Therapist: All right, Well, first I'd just like to commend you for your honesty and that's really helpful information that you shared with me. Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further? ; Client: Yeah, sure. ; Therapist: So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that- ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: -correct? ; Client: Exactly. ; Therapist: So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold. ; Client: Yeah, well, you know that sounds okay. While he's sick, I might be able to smoke outside in the next couple days or so, but the thing is, usually I'm craving a cigarette the most when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. I put Jake to bed, I open up a bottle and I pour myself a glass and I'm finally able to unwind, so, I get a craving for a cigarette, so, I'm not sure long-term I'd be able to smoke outside. ; Therapist: Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic. ; Client: Yeah, exactly and another thing is that sometimes in the morning, after I've had a couple of glasses of wine, I kinda feel tired or groggy or low on energy, so, even that I'm not sure is completely relaxing. Especially if I've had a cigarette the night before, I always feel so bad. ; Therapist: So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great. ; Client: Exactly. ; Therapist: Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines? ; Client: Sure. I've never heard of them. ; Therapist: Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you? ; Client: Well, usually I'm having more than two glasses but if you're saying that's gonna minimize some risk and I guess some of the grogginess I'm feeling the next morning, then maybe I should just try and have one glass of wine in the evenings? ; Therapist: So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing. ; Client: Yeah, I-I'd absolutely maybe reduce. I'll try my best to reduce, but I'm not sure about the smoking. ; Therapist: Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick? ; Client: Yeah. I think that sounds okay. ; Therapist: That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful? ; Client: No. I think just talking about it was helpful, you know, and I'm- I'm glad you've given me some information. Maybe just this week I can think about it a little more, you know, I-I feel pretty overwhelmed right now. There's so much to do. My days are pretty full, so, maybe I can just s-sit on it for a week. ; Therapist: Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment. ; Client: All right. That sounds good. Thanks, Dr. ; Therapist: Thanks, Hailey. We'll see you next week.",high
39,"Therapist: Um, so you've talked a bit about like the emphysema. Um, what did the doctors say to you when you were diagnosed? I mean the obvious, right? ; Client: Every time I go-- Excuse me. -to any doctor, you know, you need to quit smoking and— ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Finger comes out. ; Client: Uh-huh and I kind of go, let's move on, you know because I've heard the lecture. Um, and I really don't put much credence into what they say. I did have- I did have a neighbor who was smoked for many, many years and, um, she had the Oxygen-- Oxygen tank that she would have to sleep at night with the oxygen on and even that didn't deter me from that smoking. I don't really know. It's like, um, a power greater than myself. This is controlling me like this, you know, the angels on this side, the devil's on the other. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. And there was a war going on? ; Client: Mm-hmm, yeah. And common sense somewhere in the middle. ; Therapist: Yeah. Well, and your daughter. ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: And the social stigma, because you don't want your daughter to think of you like that, whatever that- that as a smoker, you know. You know there're people who make the assumption and it- it sounds like those are more important to you than the medical things, and who cares why it's important? ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: It doesn't matter. So what- what ideas do you have about what might be most helpful for you in quitting smoking? ; Client: Well, you know, I was thinking along the lines of meditation. Um, you know, I- I do practice yoga, um, not consistently, but on and off. Um, and when I was in the hospital, I had to do that breathing apparatus and they didn't want to let me go now, like, you know- you know what, I'm not doing that it's already blurry then to this thing, to see the level, um, some pretty obstinate about it and yet I want to do it, you know? ; Therapist: So that was helpful for you that it's a, um, I can't remember. I know what you're trying to get a little ball. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: It shows you your lung capacity. ; Client: Right. Which I barely have any. ; Therapist: But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it? ; Client: Right- right. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, I don't even know where you can get those. I think— ; Client: Oh, I already have one. ; Therapist: Oh, you have one? ; Client: Yeah, [laughs]. ; Therapist: Oh, okay- okay. ; Client: It came home with me. ; Therapist: Oh, did you? ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Okay. All right. ; Client: It's stuff that I learnt in class. ; Therapist: It's so interesting because there's immediate feedback. I mean, that's immediate feedback. Um, so we're- we're talking about quitting or here quitting completely. What thoughts do you have? You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]- ; Client: That'd be great, yeah, please. ; Therapist: So, um, since you like meditation so much, it's highly likely that you'd be a great candidate for hypnotherapy. ; Client: That's- that's something I'd be really interested in. ; Therapist: Yeah, okay. ; Client: Yeah. I mean, I- I, um, I've always liked therapy itself, and I- I've heard, I don't know if it's accurate, but if you have the willingness that is you're ease- more easily hypnotized, I don't know is it true? ; Therapist: Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you? ; Client: Well, I mean exercise, but really, you know, I have the mindset, you know, like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to get up and I'm going to do this, but I really am not a follow-through type of person with this. ; Therapist: Okay. Okay. ; Client: Because you know I've never been really athletic. I mean, so it's kind of like, I know that when you substitute something for something else, other than chocolate, which is my best friend too, [laughs]. ; Therapist: Might become a better friend when you quit. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin? ; Client: You know, I've heard of Welbutrin. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: My girlfriend quit smoking. She quit drinking. She quit doing everything with this Wellbutrin. Now I- I- I am on some medications, like some, like I think that's an antidepressant. ; Therapist: Yes, it is. ; Client: Okay. Um, I'd be open to that and then I'm not sure-- I'm not familiar with the other thing that you had suggested. Um, I don't know what that is. ; Therapist: It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them. ; Therapist: The other thing is its a slight stimulatory effect and when people go off nicotine which is a stimulant the-they tend to get pretty tired overheard-- you know it's the opposite of however the nicotine makes them feel. And the Wellbutrin kind of with stimul-- you know stimulatory enough. [crosstalk] [unintelligible 00:05:56] And I-- the last I've read, and I've not kept real current about it, but I'm wondering about the-- what your thoughts are if any about the-- any of the nicotine replacements like the gum patch, the inhaler. ; Client: Um, you know I'd be-- I've heard a little bit about them, but I mean I do know some people, but they're not exactly reliable, um, as far as you know really having a desire and sticking to it that they smoke on the patch and-and then it causes this you know extreme, you know? Like you're getting double the nicotine or whatever so it's almost like they're getting a buzz from it you know so that's my fear and the cost of the patch because it's not covered you know through your, um, your- your insurance and the Nicorette same thing it's very expensive you know. And I'm not really a gum sure but here I am because— ; Therapist: Chewing gum. ; Client: [laughs] but I mean I'd be interested I wish they'd make it more affordable for people or you know they haven't covered by insurance because you know the risk of it you know that the premiums for insurance- insurance for people who smoke are so high you would think that they would have like, um, what do they call that? Preventive. Um, I wish I never would have started and I'm proud of my daughter you know because I started smoking a little bit earlier than her age, and I'm proud that she is at this point not smoking this manifestation she might pick it up but it's- it's like- ; Therapist: That strong spirit of you got instilled with her. ; Client: Yeah-yeah, maybe I'm the best example of why she doesn't want to [laughs] you know ; Therapist: Could be? ; Client: Whatever you know and her friends. I think a lot of her friend's parents don't smoke and I'm constantly running like outside to smoke and-and- ; Therapist: It is becoming a pain in the butt ; Client: It is. It really is. It's a monkey on my back ; Therapist: Mm-hmm ; Client: And um for me smoking is like a calming effect, you know. And some people it's a stimulant you know and then for me, it's like, I look forward to relaxing on my couch after a long day and then watching my you know news or whatever the heck I'm watching or reading and having my cigarette, um, I'll tell you- ; Therapist: Like it's a little treat. ; Client: Right. Exactly or you know like I'll do some work, and then I'm like okay you know as my ex-husband says Union break and it's a cigarette break. [laughs] ; Therapist: I've never heard of Union break. I love it how you said. I love it. ; Client: Yeah. Absolutely it's not my quote but he actually he would mind. ; Therapist: I love it. Union break. ; Client: Yeah ; Therapist: It's great ; Client: Yeah, you know how those union workers have to have you know, Union break. ; Therapist: Union break. Yeah. le-leverage, and you know so it's something else you might know about nicotine is, um is that actually depending on how you smoke it, it can- it can be stimulant when you want it to be a stimulant if you smoke it in short, shallow puffs and then it can be a depressant like after a meal and you take longer inhalations, and it really tends to act on your central nervous system as a depressant. So it kind of does whatever you want at any given moment and yet there is this price that you pay ; Client: Yeah, financially too, which is [inaudible 00:09:27] ; Therapist: Financially. Right, getting back to the finances and you know, you know, you know I'm thinking your daughter what a pain but it's become the finances the emphysema. I'm really-- because I would think that in 10 years, how much are you smoking now? ; Client: Well, uh",high
60,"Client: It's good. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Um, another thing-- Wait, what, I had something, it's just [inaudible 00:00:03] that I wanted to ask you, um, now a lot of my friends have quit smoking. They're getting like ostracized, but, you know, I tend to, like, gravitate, you know, towards-- Like my ex-husband smokes, you know- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -so I find it like acceptable in that regard. ; Therapist: You bond other smokers. ; Client: Mm-hmm, yeah. ; Therapist: That's very common. I mean, you go where you know, um, no one's gonna look down on you. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: And you're instant friends. ; Client: Yeah, we share-- ""Okay, oh, a smoker, let's go out and have a smoke together,"" yeah. ; Therapist: And now a total stranger will give you a cigarette- ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -whereas like, you can't go up to him and say, ""Hey, can I have some of your McDonald's French fries,"" and take them out— ; Client: I like that piece of jewelry, can I? [laughs] ; Therapist: Right, yeah, but with cigarettes, there is a sharing. You don't see that with any other drugs? ; Client: Right. Right, yeah. You can't have my stash. [laughs] ; Therapist: You can't, no, not one of mine. So, um when are you thinking you might want to do this? ; Client: Um, you know, I guess I'll have to like, you know, get all of my information together. ; Therapist: Okay. Do your homework. ; Client: Right, do my homework and set up my like to have everything available to me. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: And then maybe set up another appointment with you. ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: And maybe I don't know if-if that's like something that you'd be, you know, willing to do with me is to- help me set a date. ; Therapist: Sure. ; Client: And then you know, the next time I see, see progress, or maybe write-- have like a diary or something, I don't know. ; Therapist: Okay. Yeah, no, all those things are good. I mean, I think you know, the will- picking a quit date has been found to be really effective. And, um, uh, I know you had talked earlier and then we'll end in just a couple minutes, but about, you know, like, the willingness or the readiness and most-- a lot of people, a lot of my clients have shared with me that when they woke up that morning, they truly had no idea that was going to be their last cigarette. ; Client: Oh, really? So they didn't have an exact date, they just decided. ; Therapist: No. Or- or some of them didn't have an exact date, but m-more importantly, was they-they just didn't know that was the day. ; Client: Oh, they didn't realize-- They didn't look at the calendar. ; Therapist: Right, right. It's just like you-you-you-- Some people pick a quit date, like January 1st is still the most popular quit date— ; Client: And-and wait, I'm sorry, but— ; Therapist: There's a smoke update coming up. ; Client: Oh, yeah. [crosstalk] And you know what I've never done that. ; Therapist: It's for the cancer society. ; Client: That's coming up in November- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -that's cool I'll have to find out about that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: Because it's like people who will start and say, ""I'm going to stop drinking at New Year's Eve. After midnight, I'm not gonna drink."" ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: That seems to be like, uh, a false setting up, you know, like, come on. ; Therapist: Actually, you would be amazed how many people do it. ; Client: Really? ; Therapist: Yeah, yeah, they really do, and smokers. Yeah, and drinkers, they do, yes. Yeah. ; Client: Or, like, you know, setting up-- but what is that that they say? Um, you know, like, it's- it's the terminology, you know, with all the anxiety and letting go, you know, like I'm gonna [crosstalk]. ; Therapist: Like a new beginning. ; Client: Yeah. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. ; Therapist: So, for you, it's your, you know, it sounds like you really want to be prepared. ; Client: Right, right. ; Therapist: And yet, on some level, you know, that it's gonna be a lot of hard work for you because of, you know, you've already known how anxious you get about a stash- ; Client: Right. ; Therapist: So if you have a stash Nicorette gum if you decide to use it, I mean, you'd have to have other stashes, you know. ; Client: Yeah, and you know, another thing, uh, uh, you know, it's so so bang, but the weight gain is like— ; Therapist: That worries you? ; Client: Uh-huh. ; Therapist: Yeah. So, so if-if your doctor says it's okay with the Wellbutrin, one-- uh, we see very little if any weight gain- ; Client: Oh, really? ; Therapist: -with the Wellbutrin, yes. ; Client: Oh, that's awesome, to know too. ; Therapist: Yeah. And, um, the same with the Nicorette gum, because it- nicotine is an appetite suppressant. ; Client: Right, right. Just like [inaudible 00:04:06] Or your chocolate and all that. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: So just switching my addiction. [laughs] ; Therapist: If you will. And that's if you decide you want to try a replacement therapy and that's what we call it and it-it kind of sounds from what you've described with your fear about you know, what it would be like of the withdrawal and everything like that. W-why you don't have to do it that way, you don't have to go cold-cold turkey. ; Client: Yeah, God, I don't think I could. ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: You know, I mean like I said three days was like- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -three years, and all I could think about I was like obsessing about it. ; Therapist: Yes. Yeah, yeah. So I think that- I think, I'm just a really big advocate of w-whatever is gonna enhance the quality and the length of your life. And if somebody becomes addicted to nicotine go- gum, God bless them. They're still gonna live longer, you know what I mean? ; Client: Yeah, yeah. ; Therapist: So— ; Client: Yeah. That's true. ; Therapist: So, we'll do that so we'll-we'll talk about the hypnosis a little bit more, you know, you'll talk to your doc. Um, you'll do your research, you know, about programs and stuff, I'll give you any information I have and we'll take it from there. But it's sounding like the quit date might be coming up fairly-- like within the next two, three months. ; Client: Okay. ; Therapist: I, uh, mean that's up to you. ; Client: Yeah. And I mean and that's-that's a reasonable thing- [crosstalk] ; Therapist: You get to decide. ; Client: -I don't feel like I'm like you know, it's gonna be-- I think gradually getting my- wrapping my brain around it will help, you know, before I just do, you know. ; Therapist: Yeah. Is it appealing the thought of quitting with a group at the same time? ; Client: You know, I always love, um, I've been in other group therapies- ; Therapist: Uh-huh. ; Client: -and the feedback is really nice and the support- ; Therapist: Okay, yeah. ; Client: -system is really good. ; Therapist: Okay. So, that really sounds like something we can do. ; Client: Yeah. ; Therapist: So, that would be can- the Cancer Society. So, we can look into that. ; Client: All right, great. Good. Great. ; Therapist: All right. Well, I appreciate you coming in. We'll set up another appointment and, um, get our resources together. We'll take it from there and— ; Client: And thank you for all the information. I appreciate it. ; Therapist: Oh, you're welcome. My pleasure, thank you. ; Client: Thank you.",high
110,"Therapist: --today. ; Client: Well, there's a lot of things that bring me here today, but the one thing that I want to focus on is the fact that I really want my son to grow up in a great environment, and just have, like, more than what I had growing up. ; Therapist: Okay. So, you want your son to grow up in a great environment and to have more than you had? ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: Is that right? so that's on your mind right now? ; Client: Yes, that's on my mind. I love my son dearly, and I don't complain about the childhood I had, I had a great childhood. I just-- I guess every parent wants the best for their kids- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -and-and I really want the best for him. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. Is there anything in particular that's happening right now where this is more of a concern for you than usual? ; Client: Yes, um, me and his father, like, we're-- We were engaged and, um, we're just not at that connection anymore. We're focused on what we want to do in life, and that's kind of put a hassle on our relationship. ; Therapist: What you want to do in life? Can you explain? ; Client: Yes, I want to become a social worker. I want to help people. That's just what I love to do, and he, um, is currently driving trucks, and so it kind of like puts a damper on everything on our relationship, and we're just like mainly focusing on our son and-and it's just been hard, like, reconnecting. ; Therapist: So you feel that your differences in career choices is-is having an impact on your relationship with your son? ; Client: Yes, I feel it is, and I just-- I always really wanted like a family, like me and the dad and-and the child. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: I-- That's how I feel, that I love my son dearly, but I want to provide him with that, like, we are together, we're doing it together as a team- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -because now that we're going away from each other it's made things more difficult. ; Therapist: Mm. Okay, so your boyfriend? ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Is he your fiance or your boyfriend? ; Client: Um, he was my fiance, but- ; Therapist: Okay. ; Client: -we called off our engagement. ; Therapist: Okay. And he's a truck driver? ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: Does he drive long distances- ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: -or just local? ; Client: He drives long distance. ; Therapist: And so sometimes he's gone away from home for, what like, days, weeks? ; Client: Yeah. Days, and the longest was, like, a week. ; Therapist: Okay. And so he's a truck driver and you are an aspiring social worker, and you have a son who you want to give a really great life to, and you feel that you and your boyfriend are in different, going in different directions- ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: -maybe? Is-- Can you elaborate on the part that you're maybe the most concerned about or that's the most on your mind right now? ; Client: I'm concerned that when he was just local, we were able to do picnics and-and-and do the whole family thing that I just really love, and even though my parents weren't together, we would still, you know-- They were really civil with each other and we would go to Disneyland, we'd go to the-the fairs, and you know, I feel like it's different. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Even though I'm not saying that we-we probably won't be together ever, there's a possibility that that could happen, but I still want that togetherness than apart. ; Therapist: Okay, okay. And so that-that realization that you're having right now is, it sounds like, it seems like maybe, just from your nonverbal, that maybe you feel like you need to make some sort of a choice. Is that right? ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: Yeah? Okay. ; Client: I feel like, um, I'm not, like, valued. We're not valued from his perspective. I mean, that's- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -what I can sense. I can't really make that a final say because he may feel something different. ; Therapist: Well, you know that he's not physically available- ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: -to do these things that you want to do- ; Client: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. ; Therapist: -like go on picnics. ; Client: And so when he is available it's kind of like, I guess where he's at and where I'm at is just like, ""Why is that a problem for you?"" And I'm like, ""It is because I want--"" ; Therapist: He's saying to you, ""why is it a problem?"" ; Client: Yeah, ""why is it a problem?"" He feels like it's always me who wants these things and-- but I-I made it clear that, you know, I want our son to grow up with the togetherness- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -especially like how my parents had it, you know. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: They weren't the best of friends but they could come together and, you know, it was better together than apart- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -and so I'm feeling like there's a-a change and I don't know whether to roll with it or just accept it, accept it. And it's all a balance between mind and-and heart and that's the battle. ; Therapist: So, your heart says you want this great relationship where there's like a true family unit and you can go on picnics and be together but your mind says, what? ; Client: Well, my mind says that it's not going that way and you can't make it turn that way, you can't change anybody, they have to change themselves. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And if they wanted to do it then, you know, it would definitely work. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And I feel like I don't wanna subject to just accepting things the way they are, especially if that's a concern for me- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -as far as dealing with the togetherness, I feel like if I have a problem, I voice it to you and we solve. You know, we'll try to figure out ways so-- I feel like I'm very more like, the collaborating person. Like, we gotta collab together, let's-- you know, I usually am that person that's, ""Let's solve this issue."" ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: ""Let's not go over the problem over and over and over."" ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: ""Let's try to think of ways to make it better."" And I notice that not everyone's like me in that sense. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And so, do I wanna eventually hurt myself in the long run? Or, you know, help myself by saying, ""Okay this is just accepting that he's not in that position, so let me just do what's for me in my heart and, you know- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -stabilize myself to be the best parent that I can be."" ; Therapist: Okay, so you know what you want, you're not so sure that your boyfriend wants the same thing. His actions indicate that he doesn't. ; Client: Mm-hmm. ; Therapist: His words indicate that he does or he doesn't? You're not sure? I'm not sure about that part either? ; Client: Yeah, I'm not sure about that part either. [chuckles] ; Client: Oh, okay, all right. ; Client: Because I know that dealing with perspectives you can, you know, you can't really tell someone what their, you know, perspective is- ; Therapist: Yeah. ; Client: -but I don't-I don't sense it, I don't feel it and, um, I think that's just what I'm going by and I feel like probably 98% true. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. So now you have this information and it's on your mind, is there-- have you given any thought about what you might want to do about it? ; Client: And that's where the sickness comes from. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: And that's what I'm confused about because, you know, I'm very-- the type of person that, I don't wanna hold things in but yet I don't want to have to keep explaining- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. [chuckles] ; Client: -to you, you know like, I don't want to keep going on, iterating what I want in this relationship- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -especially if I'm listening to you. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: You know, I would want you to listen to me. And I understand by like in the position that I'm in, I've always been the receiver and, um, anybody-- so it's hard for people to like receive, you know, from me so, I'm just like-- Lke I was like sitting, um, yesterday I was kinda feeling down and I just never-- I was looking through my phone actually, this is really funny, I was looking through my phone like, ""Who can I talk to?"" Because I never really opened up to anybody. ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: Cause they open up to me and I'm able to listen- ; Therapist: Mm-hmm. ; Client: -and so I'm like, ""Out of all this, I don't know who I'd-who I'd talk to."" ; Therapist: Oh. ; Client: -and open up to— ; Therapist: So that's another realization. ; Client: Yes. ; Therapist: It's like, ""Wow,"" it's really, really prevalent for you right now, you realize that you are the caretaker, you are the person who listens to other people but you don't necessarily have someone like that for you and so—",high
